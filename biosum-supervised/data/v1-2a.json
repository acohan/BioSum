Our analysis in vivo following KrasG12D extinction showed rapid downregulation of specific metabolic enzymes and their pathways prior to any discernible biological impact (e.g., morphological or proliferative changes), a finding consistent with the active control of tumor cell metabolism by KrasG12D. Indeed, the Kras oncogene is known to induce aerobic glycolysis (Racker et al., 1985), and PDAC cells have been shown previously to have metabolism consistent with elevated aerobic glycolysis (Zhou et al., 2011). Interestingly, this metabolic switch may be dependent on cell type or oncogenic Ras isoform as H-Ras transformed mesenchymal stem cells do not depend on increased glycolysis for ATP production during transformation (Funes et al., 2007) ... Our work establishes that KrasG12D extinction leads to inhibition of glucose uptake and a decrease in several glycolytic intermediates, including G6P, F6P, and FBP. Although aerobic glycolysis is recognized as inefficient from a bioenergetics perspective, metabolic reprogramming to a glycolytic state has been proposed as a mechanism which allows the allocation of glycolytic intermediates into biosynthetic pathways (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). Indeed, we have demonstrated the enhanced glycolytic flux is diverted into the nonoxidative PPP to facilitate ribose biogenesis. Furthermore, such hypotheses are also supported by the observation that amplification/overexpression of PHGDH, a rate-limiting enzyme functioning to divert 3-phospho-glycerate (a glycolytic intermediate) into the serine biosynthesis pathway, facilitates tumor growth in certain contexts (Locasale et al., 2011; Possemato et al., 2011)",

These mice were crossed to ROSA26-LSL-rtTA-IRES-GFP (ROSA_rtTA) (Belteki et al., 2005) and p48-Cre (Kawaguchi et al., 2002) mice to enable pancreas-specific and doxycycline (doxy)-inducible expression of KrasG12D (Figure S1B). This triple transgenic strain is designated hereafter as iKras. Doxy treatment effectively induced oncogenic Kras expression and activity (Figures S1C and S1D), but did not substantially increase total Kras expression at the mRNA or protein levels (Figures S1C and S1E). Extinction of the KrasG12D transgene occurs within 24 hr following doxy withdrawal (Figures S1C and S1D) ... Consistent with the role of KrasG12D as a driver of PDAC initiation (Hezel et al., 2006), doxy induction provokes acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and PanIN lesions within 2 weeks (Figure S1F). Similar to the LSL-KrasG12D knock-in model, induction of the KrasG12D transgene leads to infrequent occurrence of invasive PDAC after long latency (35\u201370 weeks) (Figure S1F), suggesting comparable biological activity of the KrasG12D alleles and the need for additional genetic events for tumor progression. To enable full malignant progression and assess the tumor maintenance role of KrasG12D in advanced malignancies, we crossed iKras and conditional p53 knockout (p53L) alleles (Marino et al., 2000). Following doxy treatment at 3 weeks of age, all iKras p53L/+ mice succumbed to PDAC between 11 and 25 weeks of age (median survival, 15 weeks), whereas the doxy-treated iKras p53L/L mice succumbed to PDAC more rapidly with a median survival of 7.9 weeks (Figure 1A). The iKras p53 mutant tumors exhibited features commonly found in human PDAC, including glandular tumor structures, exuberant stroma, local invasion into surrounding structures such as the duodenum, and distant metastases to the liver and lung (Figure 1B).

As shown in Figure 1C, KrasG12D extinction led to rapid tumor regression with morphological deterioration of tumor cells and rapid degeneration of stromal elements starting 48 hr and peaking at 72 hr following doxy withdrawal. After 1 week of doxy withdrawal, MRI showed a reduction in tumor mass of ~50%, whereas PET/CT showed complete loss of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (Figures 1D and 1E). On the histopathological level, virtually all malignant components of the tumor regressed with the remaining pancreata displaying collagen deposition surrounding few remnant ductal structures (Figure 1C). Correspondingly, tumor regression was accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation (BrdU incorporation) and increased apoptosis (Caspase-3 activation) 2\u20133 days after doxy withdrawal, culminating in complete loss of tumor cell proliferation at 1 week off doxy (Figures 2A and S2A; data not shown). Moreover, KrasG12D extinction effected dramatic changes in the tumor stroma as evidenced by a reduction in pancreatic stellate cells (marked by SMA staining) (Figure 2A), which is a prominent component of the classical stromal reaction in PDAC. This indicates that oncogenic Kras has significant non-cell-autonomous effects on the stromal compartment. The in vivo findings of decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of the epithelial compartment parallel cell culture assays, such as loss of clonogenic growth of primary tumor cells (Figure S2B), consistent with a role for cell-autonomous mechanisms contributing to tumor regression",

Malignant progression from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) to invasive and metastatic disease is accompanied by the early acquisition of activating mutations in the KRAS oncogene, which occurs in >90% of cases ... Consistent with the role of KrasG12D as a driver of PDAC initiation (Hezel et al., 2006), doxy induction provokes acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and PanIN lesions within 2 weeks (Figure S1F). Similar to the LSL-KrasG12D knock-in model, induction of the KrasG12D transgene leads to infrequent occurrence of invasive PDAC after long latency (35\u201370 weeks) (Figure S1F), suggesting comparable biological activity of the KrasG12D alleles and the need for additional genetic events for tumor progression. To enable full malignant progression and assess the tumor maintenance role of KrasG12D in advanced malignancies, we crossed iKras and conditional p53 knockout (p53L) alleles (Marino et al., 2000). Following doxy treatment at 3 weeks of age, all iKras p53L/+ mice succumbed to PDAC between 11 and 25 weeks of age (median survival, 15 weeks), whereas the doxy-treated iKras p53L/L mice succumbed to PDAC more rapidly with a median survival of 7.9 weeks (Figure 1A). The iKras p53 mutant tumors exhibited features commonly found in human PDAC, including glandular tumor structures, exuberant stroma, local invasion into surrounding structures such as the duodenum, and distant metastases to the liver and lung (Figure 1B). Histological analysis documented invasive PDAC in 8/8 iKras p53L/+ mice at 8 weeks after induction (Figure S1G)",

Additionally, it has been shown that the Ras oncogene promotes resistance to oxidative stress through GSH-based ROS scavenger pathways (DeNicola et al., 2011; Recktenwald et al., 2008), and this is likely mediated in part by the production of NADPH through the oxidative arm of the PPP. In fact, the oxidative arm of the PPP has been shown to be activated by Kras oncogene-mediated transformation to promote cell proliferation (Vizan et al., 2005; Weinberg et al., 2010).

To enable full malignant progression and assess the tumor maintenance role of KrasG12D in advanced malignancies, we crossed iKras and conditional p53 knockout (p53L) alleles (Marino et al., 2000). Following doxy treatment at 3 weeks of age, all iKras p53L/+ mice succumbed to PDAC between 11 and 25 weeks of age (median survival, 15 weeks), whereas the doxy-treated iKras p53L/L mice succumbed to PDAC more rapidly with a median survival of 7.9 weeks (Figure 1A). The iKras p53 mutant tumors exhibited features commonly found in human PDAC, including glandular tumor structures, exuberant stroma, local invasion into surrounding structures such as the duodenum, and distant metastases to the liver and lung (Figure 1B). Histological analysis documented invasive PDAC in 8/8 iKras p53L/+ mice at 8 weeks after induction (Figure S1G). As such, we assessed the impact of KrasG12D extinction on tumor biology and maintenance at 9 weeks after induction. As shown in Figure 1C, KrasG12D extinction led to rapid tumor regression with morphological deterioration of tumor cells and rapid degeneration of stromal elements starting 48 hr and peaking at 72 hr following doxy withdrawal",

By ChIP-PCR, we verified that several of the Rho-pathway genes were bound by GATA2 in mutant but not WT NSCLC cells (Figure 5B) ... In total, these results suggest that GATA2 directly regulates expression of Rho-signaling components ... Recognizing this regulation of Rho targets by GATA2, we assessed the functional consequences of GATA2 loss on Rho activity.

Collectively, these findings indicate that GATA2 regulates expression of the IL-1 pathway in RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC ... To determine a functional role for the IL-1 pathway in GATA2-mediated viability, we expressed TRAF6 in RAS-pathway mutant lung cancer cells, as TRAF6 overexpression exogenously activates IL-1 signaling (Cao et al., 1996)",

Interestingly, the relative effect of GATA2 loss on viability correlated with the extent of GATA2 knockdown in mutant but not WT cells ( Figure S1B) ... To further validate GATA2, we designed shRNAs against GATA2. To this end, one shRNA (shGATA2.1) achieved substantial knockdown of GATA2 in A549 and PC9 cells relative to a control (shGAPDH) and a nonfunctional GATA2 shRNA (shGATA2.2) (Figure 1C). Notably, shGATA2.1-expressing A549 and PC9 cells had greatly reduced viability relative to the other shRNAs but did not affect WT H322M cells (Figure 1D) ... As seen in Figure 2A, injection of control shRNA-expressing RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC cells led to robust tumor growth. In contrast, GATA2 knockdown cells completely abrogated tumor formation, with no detectable lesions forming over 9 months. The effect of GATA2 on RAS-pathway mutant tumors was specific, as loss of GATA2 had no impact on tumor growth in WT NSCLC cells (Figure 2B)",

Through integrated analyses of gene expression and genome occupancy, we found that this dependency occurs via concurrent regulation of three pathways: the proteasome machinery; the IL-1/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway; and the Rho-signaling cascade ( Figure 5K). These pathways exhibit extensive crosstalk, suggesting the network to be mutually reinforcing ( Figures S6C\u00f1S6E) ... Beyond this initial approach, such treatment strategies could be improved further by inhibition of IL-1 signaling with IL-1 receptor monoclonal antibodies (Dinarello, 2010). Moreover, as this approach targets a network, one could envisage a multi-tiered strategy to inhibit various points within the signaling pathways. For example, along with fasudil one could inhibit Rho signaling upstream at the ephrin receptor with dasatinib (Montero et al., 2011)",

Notably, whereas there was a substantial effect of combined bortezomib/fasudil treatment in mutant cells, the effect was much less pronounced in WT cells ( Figure S7B) ... Subsequent histopathological analysis of these animals revealed a modest decrease in tumorigenesis with bortezomib or fasudil treatment alone and a very substantial decrease in tumor growth with the combination ( Figure 7B). Quantitation of these effects revealed major reductions in tumor burden, tumor number, and average tumor size with the combination therapy relative to both control and single-drug treatments ( Figures 7C\u20137E)",

Eight weeks after infection, we compared the cohort histopathologically and observed a very large reduction in tumor burden in KG F/F animals compared to both KG +/+ and F/+ controls ( Figures 6A and 6B). Moreover, both KG F/+ and KG F/F mice exhibited a significant decrease in tumor number relative to KG +/+ controls, with KG F/F animals exhibiting a more striking decline ( Figure 6C)",

To examine combined inhibition of these pathways on KRAS mutant NSCLC, we first treated a subset of KRAS mutant and WT cells with the individual drugs and their combination. Notably, whereas there was a substantial effect of combined bortezomib/fasudil treatment in mutant cells, the effect was much less pronounced in WT cells ( Figure S7B)",

Thirty of these genes could be assessed for gene expression (i.e., they were present on the expression arrays used in this study) and 23/30 (77%) were repressed, consistent with the expected effect of hypermethylation.

The fact that IDH1/2 and TET2 mutations are mutually exclusive in AML and that IDH1/2 mutations induce hypermethylation and inhibit TET2-mediated 5-hydroxymethylation suggested that both mutations may function by altering the cytosine methylation profiles of hematopoietic cells ... Although we have previously shown that aberrant DNA methylation patterning is a characteristic feature of AML (Figueroa et al., 2010), here we demonstrate that IDH1/2-mutant AML is associated with more extensive promoter hypermethylation compared to other AML subtypes.

The most prevalent such mutations identified to date affect the genes for cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and its mitochondrial homolog IDH2. IDH1 and IDH2 lesions occur in \u223c70% of patients with lower-grade (grade II-III) brain tumors such as astrocytomas, as well as in secondary glioblastomas derived from lower-grade glial tumors ( Hartmann et al., 2009, Parsons et al., 2008, van den Bent et al., 2010 and Yan et al., 2009) ... In previous studies in glioma, it was suggested that IDH-mutant brain tumors were characterized by a methylator phenotype which favors the acquisition of IDH1/2 mutations ( Noushmehr et al., 2010). Alternatively, IDH1/2 mutations could be early events in the process of hematopoietic transformation and precede the stochastic acquisition and accumulation of epigenetic changes that eventually culminate in overt AML. However, our data suggest a more direct mechanistic link between IDH1/2 mutations and dysregulated epigenetic programming in leukemia cells. Specifically, our data suggest that DNA hypermethylation is a consequence of mutant IDH protein expression and that IDH1/2-mutant-mediated epigenetic effects contribute to AML pathogenesis.

Cotransfection of TET2 with IDH1 R132H, but not wild-type IDH1, reversed this increase in 5-OH-MeC (Figure 5A). To obtain a more quantitative assessment, we also performed flow cytometric analysis of 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity.

Cotransfection with R132H mutant IDH1 led to an \u223c40% decrease in the fluorescence intensity, whereas wild-type IDH1 had no significant impact on 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity (Figure 5B). Consistent with its proposed role in DNA demethylation, TET2 transfection also caused a decrease in 5-methylcytosine, which could be reversed by coexpression of IDH1 R132H mutant but not wild-type IDH1 (Figure S5). Together, these data suggest that expression of mutant IDH is able to inhibit the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine by TET2 and subsequent DNA demethylation",

Although IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 mutations were each identified in a significant proportion of patients in our study, there was a statistically significant inverse correlation between IDH1/2 and TET2 mutations in AML (p = 0.009, left-tailed Fisher's exact test). Specifically, we did not identify a single patient with concurrent mutations in TET2 and in IDH1 or IDH2; 0/57 IDH1/2-mutant cases were TET2-mutant versus 28/300 IDH1/2-wild-type AML cases ( Figure 4). These data suggest that TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations form a distinct mutational class in AML, and that IDH1/2 mutations and TET2 mutations have overlapping roles in AML pathogenesis ... We therefore hypothesized that 2HG produced by mutant IDH might inhibit the hydroxylation reaction of 5-methylcytosine by TET2. To test this hypothesis, we expressed FLAG-tagged TET2 in 293T cells. Consistent with previous findings (Ito et al., 2010 and Tahiliani et al., 2009), cells expressing TET2 showed higher levels of 5-OH-MeC in the nucleus as detected by immunofluorescence staining with 5-OH-MeC-specific antibody. Cotransfection of TET2 with IDH1 R132H, but not wild-type IDH1, reversed this increase in 5-OH-MeC (Figure 5A). To obtain a more quantitative assessment, we also performed flow cytometric analysis of 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Staining with an anti-FLAG antibody allowed us to discriminate between TET2-positive and TET2-negative populations; importantly, the TET2-positive population showed an \u223c4-fold increase in the 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Cotransfection with R132H mutant IDH1 led to an \u223c40% decrease in the fluorescence intensity, whereas wild-type IDH1 had no significant impact on 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity (Figure 5B). Consistent with its proposed role in DNA demethylation, TET2 transfection also caused a decrease in 5-methylcytosine, which could be reversed by coexpression of IDH1 R132H mutant but not wild-type IDH1 (Figure S5). Together, these data suggest that expression of mutant IDH is able to inhibit the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine by TET2 and subsequent DNA demethylation",

While difficult to validate at present, such thinking recasts the logic of acquired GS autonomy: successful tumor cells are those that have acquired the ability to co-opt their normal neighbors by inducing them to release abundant fluxes of growth-stimulating signals (Skobe and Fusenig 1998).

We envision that evolving analytic techniques will soon make it possible to construct comprehensive profiles of the expression and functional activities of proteases, integrins, and CAMs in a wide variety of cancer types, both before and after they acquire invasive and metastatic abilities. The challenge will then be to apply the new molecular insights about tissue invasiveness and metastasis to the development of effective therapeutic strategies ... This reconceptualization of cancer cell biology has begun to drive profound changes in how we study this disease experimentally. Continuing elucidation of cancer pathogenesis will depend increasingly upon heterotypic organ culture systems in vitro and evermore refined mouse models in vivo.

The paths that cells take on their way to becoming malignant are highly variable. Within a given cancer type, mutation of particular target genes such as ras or p53 may be found in only a subset of otherwise histologically identical tumors. Further, mutations in certain oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can occur early in some tumor progression pathways and late in others. As a consequence, the acquisition of biological capabilities such as resistance to apoptosis, sustained angiogenesis, and unlimited replicative potential can appear at different times during these various progressions. Accordingly, the particular sequence in which capabilities are acquired can vary widely, both among tumors of the same type and certainly between tumors of different types ( Figure 4). Furthermore, in certain tumors, a specific genetic event may, on its own, contribute only partially to the acquisition of a single capability, while in others, this event may aid in the simultaneous acquisition of several distinct capabilities. Nonetheless, we believe that independent of how the steps in these genetic pathways are arranged, the biological endpoints that are ultimately reached\u2014the hallmark capabilities of cancer\u2014will prove to be shared in common by all types of tumors",

In these cases, the miRNAs were usually, but not always, from the same paralogous miRNA family, often with the same seed heptamer. In those cases where the same UTR was hit by multiple miRNAs from different families (54 genes), the target sites generally did not overlap, consistent with simultaneous binding and regulation of some target genes by combinations of miRNAs ... Predicted miRNA targets populated many major GO functional categories, and for each of these categories, the number of targets for the real miRNAs greatly exceeded the average for the shuffled cohorts.

For example, when compared to the seeds of shuffled cohorts that had not been screened to control for the expected number of target sites and the expected strength of miRNA:target site interactions, the seeds of vertebrate miRNAs have approximately 1.4 times as many seed matches in vertebrate UTRs. Specifically, the seeds of vertebrate miRNAs each had an average of about 2100 perfect-complement matches in masked vertebrate UTR regions whereas random heptamers with the same base composition averaged only about 1500 matches ... A miRNA shuffling protocol, MiRshuffle, was developed to generate randomized control sequences that possess all of these properties. For a given miRNA sequence, MiRshuffle generates a series of random permutations with the same length and base composition as the miRNA, until a shuffled sequence is found that matches the parent miRNA closely in each of the four criteria listed above. The MiRshuffle procedure calculated expected frequencies using a first-order Markov model of 3' UTR composition that accounts for the long-recognized impact of dinucleotide frequency biases on the counts of longer oligonucleotides (Nussinov, 1981). As an additional control, another shuffling protocol was developed, DiMiRshuffle, which preserves the precise dinucleotide composition of both the seed and the 3' end of the miRNA, as well as the seed match count and seed:seed match folding free energy ... To assess target gene functions, we evaluated the frequency of specific gene ontology (GO) molecular function classifications (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2001) among the predicted targets of the nrMamm miRNAs and their shuffled control sequences (Table 2)",

Given an miRNA that is conserved in multiple organisms and a set of orthologous 3' UTR sequences from these organisms, TargetScan (1) searches the UTRs in the first organism for segments of perfect Watson-Crick complementarity to bases 2\u20138 of the miRNA (numbered from the 5' end)\u2014we refer to this 7 nt segment of the miRNA as the \u201cmiRNA seed\u201d and UTR heptamers with perfect Watson-Crick complementarity to the seed as \u201cseed matches\u201d; (2) extends each seed match with additional base pairs to the miRNA as far as possible in each direction, allowing G:U pairs, but stopping at mismatches; (3) optimizes basepairing of the remaining 3' portion of the miRNA to the 35 bases of the UTR immediately 5' of each seed match using the RNAfold program (Hofacker et al., 1994), thus extending each seed match to a longer \u201ctarget site\u201d; (4) assigns a folding free energy G to each such miRNA:target site interaction (ignoring initiation free energy) using RNAeval (Hofacker et al., 1994); (5) assigns a Z score to each UTR, defined as: , where n is the number of seed matches in the UTR, Gk is the free energy of the miRNA:target site interaction (kcal/mol) for the kth target site evaluated in the previous step, and T is a parameter described below (UTRs that have no seed match are assigned a Z score of 1.0); (6) sorts the UTRs in this organism by Z score and assigns a rank Ri to each; (7) repeats this process for the set of UTRs from each organism; and (8) predicts as targets those genes for which both Zi \u2265 ZC and Ri \u2264 RC for an orthologous UTR sequence in each organism, where ZC and RC are pre-chosen Z score and rank cutoffs ... The 3' UTR sequences were searched for antisense matches to the designated seed region of each miRNA (e.g., bases 2..8 starting from the 5' end).

The importance of complementarity to the 5\u2032 portion of invertebrate miRNAs has been suspected since the observation that complementary sites within the lin-14 mRNA have \u201ccore elements\u201d of complementarity to the 5\u2032 segment of the lin-4 miRNA (Wightman et al., 1993) and has been corroborated with the observation that the 5\u2032 segments of numerous invertebrate miRNAs are perfectly complementary to 3\u2032 UTR elements that mediate posttranscriptional regulation or are known miRNA targets Lai 2002 and Stark et al. 2003. Moreover, the 5\u2032 ends of related miRNAs tend to be better conserved than the 3\u2032 ends (Lim et al., 2003b), further supporting the hypothesis that these segments are most critical for mRNA recognition. To explore this hypothesis, TargetScan was applied to predict targets of the nrVert miRNA set conserved between human, mouse, and rat using versions of the algorithm differing in the miRNA heptamer defined as the seed in step 1 (Figure 2B). Consistent with residues at the 5\u2032 end of miRNAs being most important for target recognition, the highest signal:noise ratio was observed when the seed was positioned at or near the extreme 5\u2032 end of the miRNA, with signal:noise values of 2.7, 3.4, and 1.6 observed for seeds at segments 1..7, 2..8, and 3..9, respectively, and signal:noise ratios of 1.3 or less at other seed positions. We suggest that the critical importance of pairing to segment 2..8 for target identification in silico reflects its importance for target recognition in vivo and speculate that this segment nucleates pairing between miRNAs and mRNAs",

Of these 11 UTRs, mutations in eight (SMAD-1, SDF-1, BRN-3b, ENX-1, N-MYC, PTEN, Delta1, and Notch1, but not HOX-A5, MECP-2, or VAMP-2) significantly enhanced expression (p < 0.001), as expected if the endogenous miRNAs in the HeLa cells were specifying the repression of reporter gene expression by pairing to the predicted target sites (Figure 3B). Significantly enhanced expression was also observed when the analogous experiment was performed using either the full-length C. elegans lin-41 3\u2032 UTR or a 124 nt segment of the UTR containing the two previously proposed let-7 miRNA target sites (Reinhart et al., 2000), indicating that at least some of the repression of lin-41 observed in C. elegans can be recapitulated by HeLa let-7 miRNA in this heterologous reporter assay (Figure 3B). For all eight predicted human targets of endogenous HeLa miRNAs that responded to mutations, the increase in expression seen when disrupting the pairing to the miRNA seed was at least as high as that seen for mutations in the let-7 target sites of lin-41 (Figure 3B) ... Mutations in the miRNA target sites of all three of the genes that had responded to transfected miRNAs led to significantly increased reporter output in the lines expressing the cognate miRNAs, but not in the parental lines lacking the miRNAs (Figure 3B), as expected if these genes were authentic targets of the respective miRNAs",

Of the four, G6PD, BDNF, and MCSF responded to the transfected miRNAs.

Therefore, it was important to ensure that the shuffled miRNA controls matched the corresponding miRNAs closely in all sequence properties that impact the expected number and quality of TargetScan target sites",

A construct containing a mutated sequence of the miRNA binding site, 3'NFI-Amut, was also produced as a control. The different luciferase constructs were transfected into NB4 cells with a plasmid carrying a constitutive-expression cassette for miR-223 (psiU-223, Figure 4D) or with the same vector expressing an unrelated 21 nucleotide RNA (psiU-control). In these experiments, we preferred utilizing a construct expressing miR-223 under a heterologous and constitutive promoter in order to have a constant level of expression. The ability of psiU-223 to direct the expression and processing of a mature miR-223 is shown ( Figure 4D). A specific negative effect on luciferase activity was observed in the presence of miR-223 on the wild-type substrate, while no reduction in luciferase activity was obtained when the target site was mutated ( Figure 4E). The decrease in luciferase activity was similar to the translational repressor effect observed for other miRNAs on their substrates ( Poy et al., 2004). These results indicated that NFI-A is a target of miR-223",

One of the two C/EBP\u03b1 binding elements in the miR-223 promoter overlaps with a NFI-A binding site (Meisterernst et al., 1988, Bachurski et al., 1997 and Gronostajski, 2000). Indeed, NFI-A was shown to interact with this sequence in vivo; nevertheless, its binding was released upon RA treatment and substituted by that of C/EBP\u03b1. This displacement correlated with miRNA transcriptional upregulation. Notably, in cells resistant to retinoic acid and unable to undergo differentiation, the NFI-A factor remained on the miRNA promoter and no C/EBP\u03b1 binding was detected. These findings supported the hypothesis of a competition between the two proteins in the regulation of the miRNA promoter: NFI-A produces low levels of miR-223, while C/EBP\u03b1 is the differentiation-specific activator",

Figure 1A shows that, in analogy to the murine model, miR-142-5 was widely expressed in all hematopoietic cells and miR-181a was detectable in bone marrow (BM) CD34+ progenitor cells and in T lymphocytes (Chen et al., 2004). miR-223, however, was absent in B and T lymphocytes and present in BM cells, with the highest levels in the BM CD34- fraction, mostly representative of lineage-committed precursors and mature hematopoietic cells ...

Altogether, our data indicate that miR-223 plays a crucial role during granulopoiesis and point to the NFI-A repression as an important molecular pathway mediating gene reprogramming in this cell lineage ... One of the two C/EBP\u03b1 binding elements in the miR-223 promoter overlaps with a NFI-A binding site (Meisterernst et al., 1988, Bachurski et al., 1997 and Gronostajski, 2000). Indeed, NFI-A was shown to interact with this sequence in vivo; nevertheless, its binding was released upon RA treatment and substituted by that of C/EBP\u03b1. This displacement correlated with miRNA transcriptional upregulation. Notably, in cells resistant to retinoic acid and unable to undergo differentiation, the NFI-A factor remained on the miRNA promoter and no C/EBP\u03b1 binding was detected. These findings supported the hypothesis of a competition between the two proteins in the regulation of the miRNA promoter: NFI-A produces low levels of miR-223, while C/EBP\u03b1 is the differentiation-specific activator ... RNAi against NFI-A drastically increased the differentiation response of NB4 cells to RA, whereas the opposite effect was found with C/EBP\u03b1 depletion. These findings are in agreement with the roles described for NFI-A and C/EBP\u03b1. C/EBP\u03b1 has been implicated in promoting differentiation and repressing genes that play the important function of promoting growth (McKnight, 2001 and Tenen, 2001). On the other hand, NFI-A has been implicated in replication as well as in controlling changes in cell growth (Gronostajski, 2000)",

The regulatory circuitry described here provides another example of how gene reprogramming during differentiation relies on fine modulation of gene expression.

We next investigated whether C/EBP\u03b1 physically interacts with the miR-223 promoter and whether its binding correlates with miR-223 transcriptional upregulation. This association was analyzed in vivo during RA-induced granulopoiesis of NB4 and RA-resistant NB4 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (Figure 3). Cells were treated with RA for 4, 24, 48, and 72 hr, and chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with an anti-C/EBP\u03b1 antibody. DNA from the immunoprecipitates was then amplified by PCR using primers (Oligos#1) located in the promoter region close to the putative C/EBP\u03b1 binding sites (see schematic representation in Figure 3). C/EBP\u03b1 was found associated with this region after 24, 48, and 72 hr of RA induction in NB4 cells (lanes NB4 24, 48, and 72), whereas no reactivity was measurable in untreated cells (lane 0) or after 4 hr of RA treatment (lane 4). In NB4-MR4 cells, C/EBP\u03b1 was not detectable throughout all the RA treatment, with only a faint reactivity at 72 hr (lane group NB4-MR4). These results were confirmed also by quantitative PCR (right panel) ... The specificity of C/EBP\u03b1 occupancy in the region recognized by Oligos#1 was indicated by the detection of signals close to background levels when sequences located further upstream (Oligos#2) were amplified in the same chromatin preparations. These experiments showed that, in APL cells, C/EBP\u03b1 interacts in vivo with the miR-223 promoter and that this binding correlates with both miR-223 upregulation and response of these cells to RA",

We next investigated whether C/EBP\u03b1 physically interacts with the miR-223 promoter and whether its binding correlates with miR-223 transcriptional upregulation. This association was analyzed in vivo during RA-induced granulopoiesis of NB4 and RA-resistant NB4 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (Figure 3). Cells were treated with RA for 4, 24, 48, and 72 hr, and chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with an anti-C/EBP\u03b1 antibody. DNA from the immunoprecipitates was then amplified by PCR using primers (Oligos#1) located in the promoter region close to the putative C/EBP\u03b1 binding sites (see schematic representation in Figure 3). C/EBP\u03b1 was found associated with this region after 24, 48, and 72 hr of RA induction in NB4 cells (lanes NB4 24, 48, and 72), whereas no reactivity was measurable in untreated cells (lane 0) or after 4 hr of RA treatment (lane 4). In NB4-MR4 cells, C/EBP\u03b1 was not detectable throughout all the RA treatment, with only a faint reactivity at 72 hr (lane group NB4-MR4). These results were confirmed also by quantitative PCR (right panel) ... The specificity of C/EBP\u03b1 occupancy in the region recognized by Oligos#1 was indicated by the detection of signals close to background levels when sequences located further upstream (Oligos#2) were amplified in the same chromatin preparations. These experiments showed that, in APL cells, C/EBP\u03b1 interacts in vivo with the miR-223 promoter and that this binding correlates with both miR-223 upregulation and response of these cells to RA",

Our findings point to miR-223 and NFI-A as novel and crucial players in the molecular circuitry controlling human granulopoiesis ... In order to validate the NFI-A mRNA as a possible miR-223 target, we set up an assay in which the 3\u2032UTR of the NFI-A gene, including the putative miRNA target site, was inserted downstream of a luciferase ORF (3\u2032NFI-Awt, Figure 4C). A construct containing a mutated sequence of the miRNA binding site, 3\u2032NFI-Amut, was also produced as a control. The different luciferase constructs were transfected into NB4 cells with a plasmid carrying a constitutive-expression cassette for miR-223 (psiU-223, Figure 4D) or with the same vector expressing an unrelated 21 nucleotide RNA (psiU-control). In these experiments, we preferred utilizing a construct expressing miR-223 under a heterologous and constitutive promoter in order to have a constant level of expression. The ability of psiU-223 to direct the expression and processing of a mature miR-223 is shown ( Figure 4D). A specific negative effect on luciferase activity was observed in the presence of miR-223 on the wild-type substrate, while no reduction in luciferase activity was obtained when the target site was mutated ( Figure 4E). The decrease in luciferase activity was similar to the translational repressor effect observed for other miRNAs on their substrates ( Poy et al., 2004). These results indicated that NFI-A is a target of miR-223 ... miR-223 activation correlated in time with the decrease in accumulation of the NFI-A protein, while its mRNA levels remained unaltered; this, together with the experimental validation of the bona fide target site in the 3\u2032UTR, indicated that NFI-A is a target of miR-223",

In contrast, the affinities of the exchange factor for the nucleotide-bound G protein and of the nucleotide for the exchange-factor-bound G protein (the ternary complexes) are much lower (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001).

In addition to the catalytic Sec7 domain both groups contain a PH domain. The activity of the large ArfGEFs was found to be inhibited by the natural compound Brefeldin A, resulting in the collapse of the Golgi structure. Brefeldin A stabilizes the ternary ARF-GDP-GEF complex and thus traps the GEF in an unproductive complex with its substrate. Structural analysis revealed that Brefeldin A binds at the binding interface between the Sec7 domain and Arf1 and thereby stabilizes the interaction (Renault et al., 2003). An elegant approach to identify inhibitors for GEFs was recently reported for the small ArfGEFs. M69 was identified in a library of RNA aptomers due to its ability to inhibit Cytohesin-1 activity in vitro (Mayer et al., 2001). Subsequently, a chemical library was screened for molecules that could compete with M69 for binding to Cytohesin-1 resulting in identification of SecinH3. SecinH3 inhibited the ARNO and Cytohesin-1 with an IC50 in the low micromolar range in vitro. Interestingly, using this inhibitor it was found that cytohesins play a role in insulin signaling, demonstrating its applicability for in vivo systems (Hafner et al., 2006)",

In contrast, the affinities of the exchange factor for the nucleotide-bound G protein and of the nucleotide for the exchange-factor-bound G protein (the ternary complexes) are much lower (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001). Thus, the interaction of a GEF weakens the affinity for the nucleotide, and visa versa, the nucleotide weakens the affinity for the GEF. In the course of the exchange reaction the GEF displaces the bound nucleotide, and subsequently a new nucleotide displaces the GEF (Figure 2A)",

The switch regions together with the phosphate-binding loop (P loop) interact with the phosphates and a coordinating magnesium ion. Both phosphates and the magnesium ion are essential for the high-affinity binding of the nucleotide to the G protein (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001). The action of the GEF on the G protein was analyzed in several structural studies. Due to the inherent instability of the ternary complexes most structural studies have been performed with stable binary complexes between GEFs and G proteins (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998, Worthylake et al., 2000, Renault et al., 2001, Goldberg, 1998 and Itzen et al., 2006). These have revealed that the catalytic domains of the various families of GEFs are structurally unrelated and approach the G proteins from different angles (Figure 2B). However, they all use similar principles to deform the nucleotide-binding site. GEF binding induces conformational changes in the switch regions and the P loop, while leaving the remainder of the structure largely unperturbed",

Thus, microarray analysis provides an accurate reflection of expression levels for most genes and can be used to accurately detect the expression of the more common surface antigens used in the diagnostic evaluation of pediatric ALL patients ... The data presented here suggest that the single platform of gene expression profiling provides a robust and accurate approach for the diagnosis and risk stratification of pediatric ALL patients.

In addition to these specific subgroups, 65 cases (20% of the total) were identified that did not cluster into any of the leukemia subtypes ... Using gene expression profiling, we now demonstrate that the single platform of microarray expression analysis can accurately identify each of the known prognostically and therapeutically relevant subgroups of childhood ALL. Distinct gene expression profiles were identified for ALL blasts with T lineage, hyperdiploid >50 chromosomes, BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, and MLL gene rearrangement",

The same clustering method was also used to group the leukemia samples on the basis of similarities in their pattern of genes expressed (see Supplemental Data at http://www.stjuderesearch.org/data/ALL1). Remarkably, this analysis clearly identified six major leukemia subtypes that corresponded to T-ALL, hyperdiploid with >50 chromosomes, BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, and MLL gene rearrangement. Moreover, within the heterogeneous collection of leukemias that were not assigned to one of these subtypes, a subgroup of 14 cases was identified that had a distinct gene expression profile.

The chi-square metric is a statistical test of association and provides a rank-ordered list of genes for each genetic subgroup ... Unsupervised hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant analysis with variance (DAV), and self-organizing maps (SOM) were performed using GeneMaths software (v.1.5, Applied Maths, Belgium). Data reduction to define the genes most useful in class distinction was performed using a variety of metrics as detailed in the Supplemental Data at http://www.stjuderesearch.org/data/ALL1. Genes selected by the various metrics were used in supervised learning algorithms to build classifiers that could identify the specific genetic or prognostic subgroups. Algorithms used included k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), prediction by collective likelihood of emerging patterns (PCL), an artifical neural network (ANN), and weighted voting",

Enforced overexpression of p19Arf in primary MEFs induces cell cycle arrest ( Quelle et al., 1995), whereas induction of Arf by ectopically expressed E2F1 or by certain oncoproteins, such as Myc or adenovirus E1A (see below), is accompanied by apoptosis ( De Stanchina et al., 1998; Zindy et al., 1998) ...

Disruption of this pathway eliminates this form of tumor surveillance and enables oncogenes to drive uncontrolled cell proliferation.

While RB disruption is the sine qua non of retinoblastoma, RB loss occurs in many tumor types. Similarly, although mutations inactivating p16INK4a function were first mapped in familial melanoma ( Kamb et al., 1994), they have been cataloged in many other cancers ( Ruas and Peters, 1998). Mutually exclusive events resulting in RB or p16INK4a inactivation through mutation, deletion, or epigenetic silencing, or in the overexpression of cyclin D1 or Cdk4, provide genetic evidence for operation of this signaling pathway in tumor surveillance ... Cells lacking RB or INK4a, or those overexpressing cyclin D1, do not divide at an accelerated rate. On the other hand, blunted responses to extracellular growth-inhibitory signals may prevent them from terminally differentiating or undergoing senescence. As discussed below, disruption of the RB pathway initiates a compensatory p53-dependent transcriptional program that reinforces cell cycle exit or, more dramatically, triggers apoptosis. In turn, any subsequent failure of p53 function would allow such cells to remain in cycle, abnormally extending cellular lifespan",

In contrast to p16INK4a and RB, which seem to play specific roles in checkpoint control, the selective involvement of particular D-type cyclins in tumorigenesis may also reflect their normal patterns of tissue-specific expression during development. Consistent with observations that D1, and not D2 or D3, is the major D-type cyclin expressed in both retinal and mammary epithelial tissues, mice lacking cyclin D1 exhibit retinal hypoplasia and defective lobuloalveolar development of breast epithelium during pregnancy ( Fantl et al., 1995 and Sicinski et al., 1995). Conversely, enforced expression of a cyclin D1 transgene in the breast tissue of mice predisposes to mammary cancer ( Wang et al., 1994). Moreover, whereas mice overexpressing Her2/Neu or oncogenic Ras transgenes targeted to mammary epithelium rapidly develop breast cancer, they fail to do so in a cyclin D1 null background, indicating that D1 function is essential for tumorigenesis and that other D-type cyclins in breast tissue cannot compensate ( Yu et al., 2001) ... Susceptibility to familial melanoma was mapped to the INK4a-ARF locus, and the critical mutations in some kindreds affect p16INK4a but not p14ARF function ( Kamb et al., 1994). However, mice lacking Ink4a-Arf rarely develop melanoma unless crossed with animals that express a Ras transgene in appropriate target cells ( Chin et al., 1997 and Bardeesy et al., 2001). When animals containing a mutant Ink4a allele were crossed with mice lacking the entire Ink4a-Arf locus, heterozygotes spontaneously developed melanomas, and dimethylbenzanthrene treatment resulted in a higher frequency of aggressive tumors ( Krimpenfort et al., 2001). Thus, a subtle constellation of genetic events involving p16Ink4a inactivation and Arf haploinsufficiency programs a different outcome than complete loss of Ink4a-Arf, which predisposes to other tumor types ( Serrano et al., 1996)",

Such mutations can disrupt normal growth control in response to environmental cues, or can dismantle cell cycle checkpoints that otherwise limit cell division or that induce cell suicide in response to DNA damage or oncogene activation. RB and p53 are central to these processes ... There is now compelling evidence that particular components of this regulatory machinery act as tumor suppressors or protooncogenes, whose mutations occur so frequently as to prompt speculation that disabling \u201cthe RB pathway\u201d may be essential for the formation of cancer cells (Sherr, 1996, Sellers and Kaelin, 1997, Nevins, 2001, Hahn and Weinberg, 2002 and Ortega et al., 2002). While RB disruption is the sine qua non of retinoblastoma, RB loss occurs in many tumor types. Similarly, although mutations inactivating p16INK4a function were first mapped in familial melanoma ( Kamb et al., 1994), they have been cataloged in many other cancers ( Ruas and Peters, 1998). Mutually exclusive events resulting in RB or p16INK4a inactivation through mutation, deletion, or epigenetic silencing, or in the overexpression of cyclin D1 or Cdk4, provide genetic evidence for operation of this signaling pathway in tumor surveillance ... Cells lacking RB or INK4a, or those overexpressing cyclin D1, do not divide at an accelerated rate. On the other hand, blunted responses to extracellular growth-inhibitory signals may prevent them from terminally differentiating or undergoing senescence. As discussed below, disruption of the RB pathway initiates a compensatory p53-dependent transcriptional program that reinforces cell cycle exit or, more dramatically, triggers apoptosis. In turn, any subsequent failure of p53 function would allow such cells to remain in cycle, abnormally extending cellular lifespan",

Enforced overexpression of p19Arf in primary MEFs induces cell cycle arrest ( Quelle et al., 1995), whereas induction of Arf by ectopically expressed E2F1 or by certain oncoproteins, such as Myc or adenovirus E1A (see below), is accompanied by apoptosis ( De Stanchina et al., 1998; Zindy et al., 1998). Arf deficiency partially protects cells from apoptosis induced by these proteins. However, in mouse tumor models lacking functional RB or overexpressing E2F, Arf loss does not invariably diminish apoptosis or accelerate tumorigenesis ( Russell et al., 2002, Tolbert et al., 2002 and Tsai et al., 2002), indicating that E2F can activate p53 through Arf-independent pathways ... A mutant form of E2F (E2F-DB) that binds to DNA but neither interacts with Rb nor transactivates E2F target genes can displace Rb-E2F complexes from promoters. When this mutant was overexpressed in primary MEFs, disruption of Rb-E2F-mediated repression increased the expression of E2F target genes, including Arf ( Rowland et al., 2002). Despite the activation of a persistent p19Arf-mediated p53 response, cells expressing E2F-DB were immortal and resistant to ectopic overexpression of either p19Arf or p53. Therefore, Rb (family)-E2F-mediated repression is required for cell cycle exit in response to p19Arf-p53 activation ... An adenovirus expressing a mutant form of E1A that cannot bind RB should replicate selectively and kill cells lacking functional RB ( Fueyo et al., 2000). A variant in which both the viral E4 and mutant E1A genes are placed under the control of the human E2F1 promoter selectively kills tumor cells with deregulated E2F, whereas normal cells halt viral replication in an RB-dependent manner ( Johnson et al., 2002). Such viruses are effective and relatively safe systemic antitumor agents in xenograft models. Using additional variants with increased potential for lysing cycling cells should provide even further specificity and efficacy against tumor cells ( Doronin et al., 2000)",

Overexpression of E2F in established cell lines lacking ARF or p53 can enforce S phase entry even in the absence of mitogenic stimulation ( Johnson et al., 1993, Qin et al., 1994 and Shan and Lee, 1994), but nonimmortal human diploid fibroblasts instead undergo an ARF-dependent p53 response leading to G1 phase arrest and, later, to apoptosis ( Lomazzi et al., 2002) ... in mouse tumor models lacking functional RB or overexpressing E2F, Arf loss does not invariably diminish apoptosis or accelerate tumorigenesis ( Russell et al., 2002, Tolbert et al., 2002 and Tsai et al., 2002), indicating that E2F can activate p53 through Arf-independent pathways",

First, the rapid degradation of Mcl-1 following certain cytotoxic stimuli (Cuconati et al., 2003, Nijhawan et al., 2003 and Willis et al., 2005) (Figure 7 and Figure 8) may help to ensure irreversible commitment to apoptosis.

Recent studies argue that Mcl-1 has a critical, distinctive role in the control of apoptosis (Cuconati et al., 2003, Nijhawan et al., 2003 and Opferman et al., 2005). Indeed, we find that Mcl-1 greatly constrains the cytotoxic action of ABT-737. Accordingly, we show that several strategies for downregulating Mcl-1, some clinically applicable, render diverse cells highly sensitive to ABT-737, even in the face of high Bcl-2 expression ... Significantly, the expression of mcl-1 and a1 mRNA is very low in most malignancies of those types (see the Gene Expression Omnibus repository at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=geo). On the other hand, in those tumors where Mcl-1 is the predominant survival protein, such as multiple myeloma ( Zhang et al., 2002), ABT-737 is unlikely to be effective as a single agent. Thus, the expression levels of prosurvival proteins, particularly Mcl-1 and A1, in individual tumors should be valuable prognostic markers for responses to ABT-737",

In small-cell lung cancer cell lines, resistance to ABT-737 correlates with elevated Mcl-1 expression (C. Tse, S.K. Tahir, S. Fesik, S. Rosenberg, and S. Elmore, personal communication). Our results also predict that tumors initially sensitive to ABT-737 may eventually become resistant by Mcl-1 upregulation.

Indeed, we find that Mcl-1 greatly constrains the cytotoxic action of ABT-737. Accordingly, we show that several strategies for downregulating Mcl-1, some clinically applicable, render diverse cells highly sensitive to ABT-737, even in the face of high Bcl-2 expression ... Since tumors often overexpress Bcl-2 (Tsujimoto et al., 1985) or Bcl-xL, we also tested the impact of their overexpression. Even when Mcl-1 was inactivated (by expressing Noxa), Bcl-xL overexpression conferred limited resistance to ABT-737 (Figure 5C), perhaps by raising the level of ABT-737 targets. Surprisingly, however, Bcl-2 overexpression did not prevent ABT-737-induced death (Figure 5C), even though its level was sufficient to inhibit Etoposide-induced apoptosis (Figure 5D). Thus, if Mcl-1 is inactivated, Bcl-2 overexpression does not diminish the cytotoxic activity of ABT-737, and Bcl-xL overexpression does so only moderately. This suggests that combining ABT-737 with strategies to inactivate Mcl-1 has therapeutic potential, even in the many tumors where Bcl-2 is markedly elevated",

We show that this resistance reflects ABT-737's inability to target another prosurvival relative, Mcl-1. Downregulation of Mcl-1 by several strategies conferred sensitivity to ABT-737. Furthermore, enforced Mcl-1 expression in a mouse lymphoma model conferred resistance. In contrast, cells overexpressing Bcl-2 remained highly sensitive to ABT-737. Hence, ABT-737 should prove efficacious in tumors with low Mcl-1 levels, or when combined with agents that inactivate Mcl-1, even to treat those tumors that overexpress Bcl-2 ... ABT-737 holds great promise, as it avidly binds the prosurvival proteins most similar to Bcl-2 and induces Bax/Bak-dependent killing. Nevertheless, with many cells, ABT-737 was not cytotoxic on its own. Its behavior mirrored that of the BH3-only protein Bad, which we showed recently to be a relatively weak killer because it cannot engage the more divergent Bcl-2 homolog Mcl-1 (Chen et al., 2005 and Willis et al., 2005). Recent studies argue that Mcl-1 has a critical, distinctive role in the control of apoptosis (Cuconati et al., 2003, Nijhawan et al., 2003 and Opferman et al., 2005).

In conclusion, the present studies validate the feasibility of targeting Bcl-2-like proteins using BH3 mimetics such as ABT-737 to induce apoptosis (Oltersdorf et al., 2005). The mechanistic insights provided here suggest ways in which ABT-737 might be used efficaciously as a single agent and in combination therapy.

Mcl-1 expression blunts the in vivo response of E\u03bc-myc/bcl-2 bitransgenic lymphomas to ABT-737 Two independent progenitor B cell lymphomas (#9 [A and C] and #16 [B and D]) derived from E\u03bc-myc/bcl-2 bitransgenic mice ( Strasser et al., 1990) were infected with the control GFP-expressing retrovirus, or ones coexpressing Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 and GFP. The mice were injected with 106 infected tumor cells before initiating therapy 4 days later with ABT-737 (75 mg/kg given daily for 2 weeks by intraperitoneal injection) (C and D) or the vehicle alone (A and B). ABT-737 improved the survival of mice transplanted with both tumors even when Bcl-2 was overexpressed. However, Mcl-1-overexpressing lymphomas were highly resistant to ABT-737, and these mice died rapidly, akin to their untreated counterparts. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were derived from an experiment with three mice in each cohort ... Thus, our data identify Mcl-1 as a critical barrier to responsiveness to ABT-737. Its increased expression renders sensitive cells resistant in vitro and in vivo (Figure S3 and Figure 6), whereas its inactivation sensitizes resistant cells (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5) ... Thus, the expression levels of prosurvival proteins, particularly Mcl-1 and A1, in individual tumors should be valuable prognostic markers for responses to ABT-737. In small-cell lung cancer cell lines, resistance to ABT-737 correlates with elevated Mcl-1 expression (C. Tse, S.K. Tahir, S. Fesik, S. Rosenberg, and S. Elmore, personal communication). Our results also predict that tumors initially sensitive to ABT-737 may eventually become resistant by Mcl-1 upregulation. Indeed, the efficacy of ABT-737 to prolong survival of mice transplanted with a lymphoma is severely compromised if Mcl-1 is overexpressed ( Figure 6)",

Several complexes have been identified including SWI/SNF, ISWI, INO80, and M1-2/CHD, and Trithorax group (TrxG), and Polycomb group (PcG) proteins which mediate chromatin remodeling by facilitating epigenetic modification of histone tails to activate or repress gene expression, respectively [28] ... The direct transcriptional regulation of several members of these complexes places Oct4 central to the coordination of these activities. The localization of Suz12, a member of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2) at many Oct4 repressed loci in ESC [37], [39] provides indication that Oct4-Polycomb interaction may play a significant role in the active repression of lineage ... Together, these findings lead us to predict that Oct4 binding functions not only in the transcriptional repression of genes that would otherwise facilitate lineage commitment, but also presents a means whereby these loci are organized spatially within the nucleus so as to be poised for activation given the appropriate cue",

A similar change in subcellular distribution was also observed in the cells expressing the 6Myc-tagged Lats2 construct (Fig. 4B,i and C,i and ii), and the diffuse distribution of Lats2 was also observed during anaphase (Fig. 4B,ii). Interestingly, when cells enter cytokinesis, GFP-Lats2 was observed again as bright spots and the spots were distributed to daughter cells and localized at each pole (Fig. 4A,v), which is suggestive of re-localization to the centrosomes of GFP-Lats2 when the cells enter cytokinesis. Moreover, GFP-Lats2 was also found at the midbody during cytokinesis (Fig. 4A,v). Together with the previous reports that Aurora-A is localized to the interphase and mitotic centrosomes as well as to the spindle poles (Bischoff et al. 1998; Zhou et al. 1998), these results indicate that Lats2 co-localizes with Aurora-A at the centrosomes during interphase, early prophase and cytokinesis. That Lats2 localizes to centrosomes during interphase was also confirmed by its co-localization with \u03b3-tubulin (Fig. 4C)",

In prophase, these bright spots translocated toward the opposite poles of the cell (left panel, iii).

The nuclear localization of Aurora-A was detected with both of the anti-Aurora-A antibodies and we observed no signal with the secondary antibody alone in our experiments (data not shown).

Using quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, we observed a 2-fold effect on LATS2 RNA levels and 4- to 5-fold on protein levels by the miR-371-3 cluster (Figure 5C). As a control, we used a LATS2 knockdown construct (Figure 5F). These results show that a combined effect of RNA destruction and translation inhibition is used by miR-372&3 to silence LATS2. miR-372/3 was predicted to bind two sites in the 3\u2032UTR of LATS2 that are highly conserved between human, mouse, and zebrafish (Figure 5D). To further substantiate LATS2 as a direct target of miR372&3, we cloned its 3\u2032UTR downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-LATS2). We transfected either pGL3-LATS2 or the controls pGL3-372 and pGL3-373 (containing a miR-complementary sequence in their 3\u2032UTR) or pGL3 into Tera1 and MCF-7 cells (respectively positive and negative for miR-371-3) ( Figures 4D and S6). As predicted, the 372/373 complementary sequences mediated strong inhibition of luciferase expression in Tera1 cells. Significantly, a potent inhibition of luciferase activity was also mediated by the 3\u2032UTR of LATS2 in either MCF-7 ectopically expressing miR-372 or in Tera1 cells but not by a construct mutated at both miR-372-predicted target sites ... Next, we tested whether LATS2 is a functional target of miR-372&3 using a YFP-competition assay. Indeed, inhibition of LATS2 conferred a growth advantage to cells expressing RASV12 (Figure 5F). The overall effect was less than the effect of the miR-Vec 373 but comparable to loss of p53. Therefore, these results point to LATS2 as a mediator of the miR-372 and miR-373 effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, although they do not exclude the participation of other direct miR-targets, such as Suv39-H1, in these processes",

Here, we use this model system to perform a functional genetic screen to identify miRNAs that act as oncogenes in tumorigenesis. We characterize two miRNAs whose expression can substitute for the loss of wild-type (wt) p53 that is needed to overcome oncogene-mediated arrest and implicate their involvement in the formation of testicular germ cell tumors ... We demonstrate here the power of this technology by the identification of miRNA-372 and miRNA-373 as potential oncogenes that collaborate with oncogenic RAS in cellular transformation (Figure 5G)",

Both in the absence of RASV12 and in its presence, a significant reduction in LATS2 protein level was observed upon miR-372&3 expression (Figure 5B). Using quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, we observed a 2-fold effect on LATS2 RNA levels and 4- to 5-fold on protein levels by the miR-371-3 cluster (Figure 5C). As a control, we used a LATS2 knockdown construct (Figure 5F). These results show that a combined effect of RNA destruction and translation inhibition is used by miR-372&3 to silence LATS2 ...

Indeed, inhibition of LATS2 conferred a growth advantage to cells expressing RASV12 (Figure 5F). The overall effect was less than the effect of the miR-Vec 373 but comparable to loss of p53. Therefore, these results point to LATS2 as a mediator of the miR-372 and miR-373 effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, although they do not exclude the participation of other direct miR-targets, such as Suv39-H1, in these processes ... Although the exact mechanism responsible for this effect is still unclear, we suggest that suppression of LATS2 is an important factor. Indeed, the expression of LATS2 is directly controlled by miR-372&3, and its activity is important for RASV12-induced senescence. However, further investigation is required to demonstrate the exact mechanism of LATS2 action and whether there are other targets of miR-372&3, such as Suv39H1, that are relevant to this phenotype",

We report here that this type of G1 arrest builds up in two different and mechanistically distinct phases: initiation and maintenance. The initial process is fast (accomplished in a period of less than 10 hr), strong (more than 15% increase in G1 in an asynchronous population), and is mediated by cyclin D1 degradation. p53 activity is dispensable for G1 arrest in this initial period ... We demonstrate here that cyclin D1 has a functional RxxL motif, also known as a destruction box, within its amino terminus. This destruction box does not play a role in the normal metabolic turn-over of cyclin D1 protein (Figure 4), but mediates rapid cyclin D1 degradation after exposure to genotoxic stress ... In support of this view is our finding that the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex specifically associates with the APC in cycling cells (Figure 5). Whereas the interaction of APC with CDK4 remains intact in cells exposed to IR, the interaction with cyclin D1 decreases rapidly. Therefore, it seems that CDK4 serves as a bridging factor between cyclin D1 and the APC",

In support of this view is our finding that the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex specifically associates with the APC in cycling cells (Figure 5). Whereas the interaction of APC with CDK4 remains intact in cells exposed to IR, the interaction with cyclin D1 decreases rapidly.

In response to DNA damage, such as ionizing radiation (IR), p53 is required for G1 arrest (reviewed in Lakin and Jackson 1999), apoptosis (reviewed in Sionov and Haupt 1999), and to sustain arrest of cells prior to M phase (Bunz et al. 1998)",

The initial process is fast (accomplished in a period of less than 10 hr), strong (more than 15% increase in G1 in an asynchronous population), and is mediated by cyclin D1 degradation. p53 activity is dispensable for G1 arrest in this initial period ... This p53 response depends on several time-consuming processes and is therefore inherently slow. Therefore, the p53 response appears more suited to maintain and further strengthen an already established G1 arrest, rather than to initiate it. This notion is supported by the present data, which show that p53 hardly contributes to G1 arrest in the first 10 hr after exposure to IR. Our results suggest strongly that the initial phase of G1 arrest following IR relies primarily on downregulation of cyclin D1 protein levels",

Destruction boxes were first identified in mitotic cyclins (Glotzer et al. 1991). The Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC), a multimeric ubiquitin ligase complex of 1.5 MDa, is essential for destruction box-mediated degradation of mitotic cyclins (11 and 15) ... Our identification of the RxxL destruction motif as a necessary element for cyclin D1 degradation points to the involvement of APC in this process",

Such pro-inflammatory effects might be important for anti-viral immune responses. In addition, programmed necrosis may control the viral factory by eliminating the infected host cells. An anti-viral role for programmed necrosis is further bolstered by our previous findings that certain viral FLIPs (FLICE-like inhibitor proteins) are potent inhibitors of TNF-induced programmed necrosis (Chan et al., 2003). These results suggest that viral inhibition of programmed necrosis is an important immune evasion strategy for certain viruses ... TNF-TNFR interactions are known to be important for the innate immune defense against VV infection (Chan et al., 2003; Ruby et al., 1997). The requirement for RIP3 to induce cell death in VV-infected cells suggests that TNF might confer protection against VV via RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis. To test this hypothesis, we infected wild type and RIP3-/- mice with VV. Consistent with its innate immune protective role, TNF expression was detected in peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) 24 hours post-infection (Fig. 7A). Moreover, TNF expression was induced in the liver and spleen of infected wild type and RIP3-/- mice (Fig. 7B). Thus, virus-induced TNF expression was not impaired in the RIP3-/- mice ... An important role for RIP1/RIP3-mediated programmed necrosis in anti-viral responses is further bolstered by our previous discovery of certain viral FLIPs that potently inhibit programmed necrosis (Chan et al., 2003). More recently, the M45 viral cell death inhibitor from murine cytomegalovirus was shown to interact with RIP1 and RIP3 via the RHIM (Upton et al., 2008). These results suggest that like apoptosis, inhibition of programmed necrosis might be an emerging viral immune evasion strategy",

We show that RIP3 acts upstream to phosphorylate RIP1, which in turn mediates downstream RIP3 phosphorylation. Both RIP3 and the kinase activity of RIP1 are essential for stable formation of the RIP1-RIP3 pro-necrotic complex, which critically controls downstream reactive oxygen species (ROS) production ... Because RIP1 is recruited to both Complex I and Complex II, we examined RIP3 recruitment to these signaling complexes. In TNFR-2+ Jurkat 4E3 cells, TNF triggers both apoptosis and programmed necrosis, although apoptosis predominates due to its faster kinetics unless caspases are inhibited (Zheng et al., 2006). In TNFR-2+ Jurkat 4E3 cells, RIP3 was recruited to caspase-8-associated Complex II (Fig. 2E), but not to TNFR-1 associated Complex I (Fig. 2F). On short exposure, zVAD-fmk moderately enhanced RIP1 and RIP3 binding to caspase-8-associated Complex II (Fig. 2E). However, the difference was minor and not distinguishable on longer exposure (Fig. S3). On longer exposure, RIP1 cleavage in Complex II was also visible (Fig. S3). Although RIP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D324 might inactivate the RIP1 kinase function and contribute to the bifurcation of apoptosis and programmed necrosis (Lin et al., 1999), zVAD-fmk likely sensitizes cells to programmed necrosis via additional regulatory events because full length RIP1 was still readily detected without caspase inhibition (Fig. S3) ... One physiological situation in which caspases are inhibited and programmed necrosis might be important is during viral infections (Benedict et al., 2002). To test this hypothesis, we examined cell death responses in activated wild type and RIP3-/- T-cells infected with vaccinia virus (VV), which encodes the viral caspase inhibitor B13R/Spi2. VV-infected cells were resistant to death receptor-induced apoptosis but become sensitized to TNF-induced necrosis (Li and Beg, 2000). Wild type T-cells infected with recombinant GFP-VV exhibited normal T-cell activation-induced cell death (AICD) induced by anti-CD3 antibody (Fig. 6A, compare the white bars). In contrast, AICD in GFP-VV infected RIP3-/- T-cells was significantly reduced compared with uninfected GFP- cells in the same culture (Fig. 6A, compare the black bars). VV-infected RIP3-/- cells were also protected from TNF-induced cell death (Fig. 6B, black bars). In fact, TNF stimulated the proliferation of GFP+ VV-infected RIP3-/- cells, which accounted for the negative cell loss. VV-infected wild type T-cells also exhibited a modest decrease in TNF-induced cell death due to the inhibition of caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 6B, white bars)",

RIP3 regulates necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of RIP1 and RIP3 stabilizes their association within the pro-necrotic complex, activates the pro-necrotic kinase activity, and triggers downstream reactive oxygen species production. The pro-necrotic RIP1-RIP3 complex is induced during vaccinia virus infection. Consequently, RIP3-/- mice exhibited severely impaired virus-induced tissue necrosis, inflammation, and control of viral replication. Thus, RIP3 controls programmed necrosis by initiating the pro-necrotic kinase cascade that is essential for the innate inflammatory response against virus infections ... To further define the molecular regulation of programmed necrosis, we examined the recruitment of RIP1 and RIP3 to Complex II in MEFs because the role of RIP3 in the assembly of the pro-necrotic complex could be evaluated using RIP3-/- MEFs. Similar to Jurkat cells, constitutive association between RIP3 and FADD was also detected in MEFs (Fig. 4A). When programmed necrosis was induced in wild type MEFs with TNF, cycloheximide and zVAD-fmk (T/C/Z) (Fig. S5), RIP1 was recruited to FADD in a TNF-dependent manner (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Moreover, TNF treatment led to further recruitment of RIP3 to the FADD-associated Complex II and RIP3 modification that resembles polyubiquitination (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Strikingly, RIP1 recruitment to Complex II was severely impaired in RIP3-/- MEFs (Fig. 4A, lanes 5-8). The RIP1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) (Degterev et al., 2008) also abolished RIP1 recruitment to FADD and inhibited additional RIP3 binding to the complex (Fig. 4A, lane 4 and Fig. S6). These results indicate that both RIP1 and RIP3 are critical for the assembly of the pro-necrotic Complex II ... Although RIP3 was not identified as a necrosis mediator in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen (Hitomi et al., 2008), we show that formation of a unique pro-necrotic Complex II composed of RIP1 and RIP3 is a crucial first step in the induction of programmed necrosis. RIP3 acts upstream to regulate necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. However, since the level of RIP1 phosphorylation by ectopically expressed RIP3 was low, it remains possible that RIP3 may activate another kinase that directly phosphorylates RIP1. Interestingly, the RIP1 kinase activity is also required for RIP3 phosphorylation during programmed necrosis. Because ectopically expressed RIP1 did not phosphorylate RIP3, RIP1 may facilitate RIP3 phosphorylation by activating another downstream kinase",

Although RIP3 was not identified as a necrosis mediator in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen (Hitomi et al., 2008), we show that formation of a unique pro-necrotic Complex II composed of RIP1 and RIP3 is a crucial first step in the induction of programmed necrosis. RIP3 acts upstream to regulate necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. However, since the level of RIP1 phosphorylation by ectopically expressed RIP3 was low, it remains possible that RIP3 may activate another kinase that directly phosphorylates RIP1. Interestingly, the RIP1 kinase activity is also required for RIP3 phosphorylation during programmed necrosis. Because ectopically expressed RIP1 did not phosphorylate RIP3, RIP1 may facilitate RIP3 phosphorylation by activating another downstream kinase",

We validated these results in TNFR-2+ wild type Jurkat cells (clone 4E3) and found that individual RIP3-specific siRNAs efficiently reduced RIP3 protein expression (Fig. 1A) and inhibited TNF/zVAD-fmk-induced programmed necrosis (Fig. 1B), but had little or no effects on apoptosis induced by TNF or FasL (Fig. 1C-D). Consistent with a previous report (Newton et al., 2004), RIP3 deficiency did not alter TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation (Fig. 1E). Thus, unlike RIP1, RIP3 is a specific activator for programmed necrotic cell death ... RIP3 contains an N-terminal kinase domain with ~ 40% identity with the kinase domain of RIP1 (Fig. 2A). A kinase-defective (KD) RIP3 mutant failed to restore TNF-induced programmed necrosis in Jurkat cells whose endogenous RIP3 expression was silenced by siRNA (Fig. 2B, RIP3-null Jurkat cells), indicating that the RIP3 kinase activity is crucial for programmed necrosis ... In contrast, silencing RIP1 or RIP3 expression in L929 cells had no effect on hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative cell injury (Fig. 5D-E). By contrast, siRNA-mediated silencing of RIP1 or RIP3 inhibited zVAD-fmk-induced necrosis in L929 cells (Fig. 5F-G), which was recently shown to be driven by autocrine TNF production (Hitomi et al., 2008). Thus, our results indicate that RIP3 acts upstream to regulate ROS production during programmed necrosis",

In TNFR-2+ Jurkat 4E3 cells, TNF triggers both apoptosis and programmed necrosis, although apoptosis predominates due to its faster kinetics unless caspases are inhibited (Zheng et al., 2006). In TNFR-2+ Jurkat 4E3 cells, RIP3 was recruited to caspase-8-associated Complex II (Fig. 2E), but not to TNFR-1 associated Complex I (Fig. 2F). On short exposure, zVAD-fmk moderately enhanced RIP1 and RIP3 binding to caspase-8-associated Complex II (Fig. 2E). However, the difference was minor and not distinguishable on longer exposure (Fig. S3). On longer exposure, RIP1 cleavage in Complex II was also visible (Fig. S3). Although RIP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D324 might inactivate the RIP1 kinase function and contribute to the bifurcation of apoptosis and programmed necrosis (Lin et al., 1999), zVAD-fmk likely sensitizes cells to programmed necrosis via additional regulatory events because full length RIP1 was still readily detected without caspase inhibition (Fig. S3) ... Although RIP3 was not identified as a necrosis mediator in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen (Hitomi et al., 2008), we show that formation of a unique pro-necrotic Complex II composed of RIP1 and RIP3 is a crucial first step in the induction of programmed necrosis.

VV-infected cells were resistant to death receptor-induced apoptosis but become sensitized to TNF-induced necrosis (Li and Beg, 2000) ... The sensitization to programmed necrosis by VV infection was also observed in MEFs. While TNF alone did not cause cell death in MEFs (Fig. S6), VV-infected MEFs were highly sensitive to TNF-induced necrosis in a RIP3-dependent manner (Fig. 6D). Electron microscopy confirmed that VV-infected underwent necrotic-like cell death in response to TNF (Fig. 6E, panel c). Importantly, while RIP1-RIP3 complex was only detected when cells were stimulated with T/C/Z (Fig. 4E-G) or TNF/zVAD (Fig. 6F, lanes 3-4), TNF alone was sufficient to trigger RIP1-RIP3 association in VV-infected MEFs (Fig. 6F, lanes 5-8). This is in stark contrast to uninfected cells, in which TNF did not trigger RIP1 and RIP3 interaction (Fig. 6F, lanes 1-2).

We validated these results in TNFR-2+ wild type Jurkat cells (clone 4E3) and found that individual RIP3-specific siRNAs efficiently reduced RIP3 protein expression (Fig. 1A) and inhibited TNF/zVAD-fmk-induced programmed necrosis (Fig. 1B), but had little or no effects on apoptosis induced by TNF or FasL (Fig. 1C-D) ...

In fact, TNF stimulated the proliferation of GFP+ VV-infected RIP3\u2212/\u2212 cells, which accounted for the negative cell loss. VV-infected wild type T-cells also exhibited a modest decrease in TNF-induced cell death due to the inhibition of caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 6B, white bars)",

RIP3\u2212/\u2212 mice failed to initiate virus-induced tissue necrosis and inflammation, resulting in highly elevated viral replication and mortality. These results show that RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis is important for virus-induced inflammation and innate immune control of viral infections ... To test this hypothesis, we examined cell death responses in activated wild type and RIP3\u2212/\u2212 T-cells infected with vaccinia virus (VV), which encodes the viral caspase inhibitor B13R/Spi2. VV-infected cells were resistant to death receptor-induced apoptosis but become sensitized to TNF-induced necrosis (Li and Beg, 2000) ... Taken together, these results show that RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis is an important cell death mechanism when the cellular apoptosis machinery was inhibited by viral inhibitors",

Intriguingly, a variety of human tumors including those arising in breast, ovary, and lung activate expression of neuron-specific genes. In some instances, the inappropriate expression of these neural genes elicits an autoimmune response that culminates in neurological disorders, collectively known as paraneoplastic neurologic degenerations (PND; see Discussion) ( Albert and Darnell, 2004). Such aberrant neural gene expression suggests that these cancers harbor defects in regulators of neuronal programs. Consequently, we investigated a potential role for REST in human tumor suppression ... REST is widely expressed throughout nonneuronal tissues including the colonic epithelium (Figure S1) (Chong et al., 1995 and Schoenherr and Anderson, 1995). The above results suggest that loss of REST expression may confer a selective advantage during the evolution of tumor cells. This hypothesis predicts that cells with defective REST function may be sensitive to reconstitution of REST. We examined this prediction by ectopically expressing REST in colon cancer cells that have lost (SW1417) or retain (SW620) endogenous REST expression (Figure 4A). Exogenous REST expression elicited a mild decrease in the proliferation of SW620 colon cancer cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, ectopic REST expression significantly reduced colony formation in SW1417 cells (>50-fold; Figure 4B), indicating that these cells are highly dependent on the absence of REST for their proliferation in vitro. Coupled with the function of REST in suppressing epithelial cell transformation (Figure 1E), these data strongly support a role for REST in tumor suppression",

In such models, primary cells are transformed into tumorigenic derivatives by the coexpression of cooperating oncogenes (Elenbaas et al., 2001, Hahn et al., 1999 and Zhao et al., 2004). These experimental models have been useful in delineating the minimum genetic perturbations required for transformation of various human cell types as well as evaluating the functional cooperation between a gene of interest and a defined genetic context. To date, these models of human cell transformation have incorporated genes already implicated in human tumorigenesis. However, such models also provide a potentially useful platform for the identification of new pathways that contribute to the transformed phenotype ... We have utilized such an RNAi-based, forward genetic approach to identify genes that suppress oncogenic transformation in a defined human mammary epithelial cell model. We identified approximately 25 potential suppressors of epithelial cell transformation (SECT) genes that represent candidate tumor suppressors. Several are associated with known cancer-relevant pathways including Ras, PI(3)K, and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. In addition, we provide evidence that one of these candidates, the transcriptional repressor REST/NRSF, plays a previously unappreciated role in tumor suppression. These findings support the utility of this novel approach to the identification of cancer relevant genes ... The novelty of this genetic approach is in the unbiased identification of new and unanticipated tumor suppressor functions. In this regard, our studies provide significant evidence for the identification of a novel tumor suppressor, the transcriptional repressor REST/NRSF (see below)",

As illustrated in Figure 5A, conditional ablation of B-Raflox alleles in K-RasG12V-induced NSCLC did not increase survival (50% survival of K-Ras+/G12V;B-Raflox/lox mice [n = 25] at 41.5 versus 40 weeks in K-Ras+/G12V;B-Raf+/+ control animals [n = 28], a 5% increase). The number and grade of tumors in mice lacking B-Raf 6 months after Ad-Cre treatment were similar to those present in control mice ( Figures 5B and 5C). Efficient recombination of the B-Raflox alleles in tumor tissue was determined by Southern ( Figure S5) and western ( Figure 5D) blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry staining with an anti-B-Raf antibody further confirmed the absence of B-Raf expression in tumor tissue ( Figure 5E). Interestingly, elimination of B-Raf expression had no effect on the levels of Mek and Erk phosphorylation, as determined by either western blot ( Figure 5D) or immunohistochemical ( Figure 5E) analysis. These observations suggest that in the absence of B-Raf, other Raf proteins can maintain mitogenic signaling through the Mek/Erk pathway. This compensatory effect did not involve increased expression of the other Raf kinases ( Figure 5D) ... Next, we investigated whether c-Raf kinase was also dispensable for K-RasG12V-driven NSCLCs. Ad-Cre treated K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice survived significantly longer than the control cohort.

To examine whether they also played unique roles during K-RasG12V-driven NSCLC, we crossed K-Ras+/G12V mice with B-Raflox/lox ( Chen et al., 2006) and c-Raflox/lox ( Jesenberger et al., 2001) animals and submitted them to infection with Ad-Cre particles. As illustrated in Figure 5A, conditional ablation of B-Raflox alleles in K-RasG12V-induced NSCLC did not increase survival (50% survival of K-Ras+/G12V;B-Raflox/lox mice [n = 25] at 41.5 versus 40 weeks in K-Ras+/G12V;B-Raf+/+ control animals [n = 28], a 5% increase). The number and grade of tumors in mice lacking B-Raf 6 months after Ad-Cre treatment were similar to those present in control mice ( Figures 5B and 5C). Efficient recombination of the B-Raflox alleles in tumor tissue was determined by Southern ( Figure S5) and western ( Figure 5D) blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry staining with an anti-B-Raf antibody further confirmed the absence of B-Raf expression in tumor tissue ( Figure 5E). Interestingly, elimination of B-Raf expression had no effect on the levels of Mek and Erk phosphorylation, as determined by either western blot ( Figure 5D) or immunohistochemical ( Figure 5E) analysis. These observations suggest that in the absence of B-Raf, other Raf proteins can maintain mitogenic signaling through the Mek/Erk pathway. This compensatory effect did not involve increased expression of the other Raf kinases ( Figure 5D) ... Next, we investigated whether c-Raf kinase was also dispensable for K-RasG12V-driven NSCLCs. Ad-Cre treated K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice survived significantly longer than the control cohort. Whereas 50% of K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raf+/+ animals (n = 22) had to be sacrificed by 38 weeks of age, half of K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice (n = 23) were alive at 63 weeks. This difference represents an 83% increase in survival ( Figure 6A). As expected, this increased survival was a direct consequence of the reduced number of tumors present in K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice 6 months after Ad-Cre treatment ( Figures 6B and 6C). More importantly, each tumor tested (n = 11) retained c-Raflox alleles ( Figure 6D). These results were confirmed by western blot analysis of nine independent tumors ( Figure 6D). These observations indicate that NSCLCs driven by K-RasG12V cannot develop in the absence of c-Raf and that the tumors responsible for the death of the K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice must be \u201cescapers,\u201d as previously observed in mice lacking Erk1/2 and Mek1/2 kinases ... B-Raf was completely dispensable for K-Ras oncogenic signaling, at least within the context of NSCLC. Moreover, phosphorylation of Erk proteins within the tumor appeared to be unaffected, suggesting that other Raf kinases mediate K-Ras oncogenic signaling in the absence of B-Raf",

Southern blot analysis of DNA isolated from tissues of sick/moribund animals revealed recombination rates of Mek1lox alleles ranging from 70% to 80% in most tissues ( Figure S4A). These observations indicate that the Mek kinases are also essential for adult homeostasis. Whether a single Mek allele might be sufficient to sustain adult life remains to be determined. Necropsy analysis of moribund mice reveled multiple defects, including severe alterations in the structure of intestinal and colonic tissue incompatible with life (Figure S4B). Even limited ablation of Mek alleles resulted in significant alterations of the normal architecture, including distorted crypts, blunted and shorter villi, increased lamina propria, and goblet cell hyperplasia. Likewise, the colonic tissue of Mek1lox/lox;Mek2\u2212/\u2212;RERTert/ert mice displayed loss as well as severe shortening of the crypts ( Figure S4B)",
