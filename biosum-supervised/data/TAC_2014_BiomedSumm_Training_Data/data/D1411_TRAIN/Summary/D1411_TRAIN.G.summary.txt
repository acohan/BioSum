The manuscript by Fazi et al. 2005 describes the identification of a new CCAAT enhancer protein (C/EBPa) target, the miR-223 gene, which undergoes activation during granulocyte differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (APL). The major impact of this reference manuscript is that miR-223 plays a role in granulocyte differentiation, which is regulated by two transcription factors: NFI-A and C/EBPa. The implications of this manuscript were primarily referred to included: mechanism of miR-223 myeloid expression involving transcription factors nuclear factor 1 A-type (NFI-A) and C/EBPa, miR-223 is highly conserved and is characterized in human cells, promoter of miR-223 is activated upon induction of miR-223 during all trans retinoic acid (ARTRA)-induced differentiation of the APL cell line NB4 cells, miR-223 regulates granulocyte development, expression of miR-223 is related to hematopoiesis, miR-223 regulates granulopoesis by a feedback mechanism, and elements upstream of miR-223 interact with transcription factors. One citing manuscript referred to the methods including the methods for reassessing miR-223 regulation, which involved densitometric analysis. One citing manuscript referred to this article by stating that” tissues have many cell types and each cell type may regulate let-7a expression with a distinct mechanism in which DNA methylation may or may not be involved”; The reference article does not state anything about different cell types in tissues nor the role of let-7a or DNA methylation. In conclusion, this reference manuscript describes the role of miR-223 in granulocyte differentiation and miR-223 expression was found to be regulated by transcription factors in a feedback loop type mechanism.
