Fazi et al., 2005 reports a regulatory circuitry identifying transcription factors, C/EBPα and NFI-A  as targets of miR-223. By generating probes for human miR-223 and others miRNAs, the authors show that miR-223 expression is associated with myelopoiesis differentiation. miR-223 was found to be specific in RA induced granulocytic differentiation of myeloid cells. C/EBPα binding sites were identified upstream of the region encoding pre-miR-223 sequence which was found to be necessary for miR-223 activation. APL cells were used for the experiments which showed that C/EBPα interacts with miR-223 affecting their response to RA and miR-223 upregulation. It is reported that NFI-A site overlaps with one of the two binding sites identified for C/EBPα and thus, hypothesize that these two may have some functional interrelationship. Using luciferase based reporter assay in NB4 cells, NFI-A is identified as a target for miR-223. Ectopic expression and knockdown of miR-223 in NB4 cells showed that the levels of miR-223 are important for deciding the fate of differentiation in promyelocytic precursors. Using RNA interference, the authors report that there exists a connecting regulatory circuitry between C/EBPα and NFI-A such that sustained levels of C/EBPα and lower levels of NFI-A are required for myeloid differentiation. However, later Fukao et al., 2007 conducted a similar study which could not find such a relation in murine miR-223 stating that human miR-223 regulation reported in this paper might not be a conserved mechanism. Altogether, this paper reports the role of miR-223 in granulopoiesis and NFI-A as its novel key regulator.
