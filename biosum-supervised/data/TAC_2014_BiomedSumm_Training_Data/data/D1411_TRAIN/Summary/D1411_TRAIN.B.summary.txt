	Fazi et al., 2005 reports on the role of miR-223 in the differentiation of the hematapoietic lineage, specifically the maturation of granulocytes. Additionally, the authors discover a potential mechanism by which miR-223 guides granulopoiesis in human cells. The authors use NB4 cells derived from APL patients as a model system as they are easily induced with retinoic acid to differentiate and undergo maturation. Initially miR-223 was shown to be expressed primarily in lineage-committed precursor cells and also in mature hematapoietic cells in murine cells. The authors confirm this expression in human cells. Additionally miR-223 was shown to be upregulated upon retinoic acid induced granulocyte differentiation. The authors identified potential binding sites for the transcription factor C/EBPα in the promoter of miR-223. C/EBPα binding of the miR-223 promoter following retinoic acid treatment was confirmed through ChIP analysis.  These binding sites were shown to be necessary for miR-223 accumulation following retinoic acid treatment. Next the authors show NFI-A, another transcription factor that binds the miR-223 promoter, competes with C/EBPα. NFI-A maintains low expression of miR-223 at basal levels while C/EBPα binding results in the upregulation of miR-223 to levels needed for granulocytic differentiation. Additionally the authors show NFI-A is itself a validated target of miR-223 repression. Lastly, through ectopic miR-223 expression or miR-223 inhibition the authors demonstrate the importance of miR-223 levels during granulopoiesis. Together these results demonstrate an example of a regulatory feedback loop where the levels of two known transcription factors to modulate the levels of miR-223 to affect differentiation.
