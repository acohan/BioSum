Abstract
To clarify the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in erythropoiesis, the expression of miR-155, miR-221, miR-223, and miR-451 were analyzed during the differentiation of purified normal human erythroid progenitors in a liquid culture system. Cells increased almost 500-fold in a number, and differentiated to benzidine-positive mature erythroblasts. Analyses of miRNA expression using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression level of miR-155 decreased about 200-fold, and that the expression of miR-451 increased about 270-fold during 12 days of cultures. A moderate down-regulation of miR-221 and miR-223 was observed. MiR-451 was expressed in red blood cells about 104-fold more than in granulocytes, obtained from normal human peripheral blood. These observations suggest that miR-155 and miR-451 are key molecules for normal erythroid differentiation, and that quantitative assays of the two miRNAs may be a relevant method for analyzing pathological erythropoiesis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are functional RNAs transcribed from non-coding regions of the genome [1] and [2]. MiRNAs are negative regulators which suppress the gene functions through translational repression by targeting 3′-UTR in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of protein-coding genes, or by inducing instability of mRNAs [1] and [2]. One miRNA has a dozen target genes, while one gene has several binding sequences for multiple miRNAs [3]. Therefore, miRNAs are components of the gene regulating network system. Furthermore, a recent bioimformatic study suggested crosstalk between miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs), thus resulting in a huge complicated network to control molecular events required for cellular functions [3]. Dynamic changes of several miRNAs during human hematopoesis are reported. MiR-155 is highly expressed in CD34(+) undifferentiated cells in human cord blood [4]. MiR-223 seems to be a target molecule of TFs regulating granulopoiesis [5]. The down-regulation of c-kit expression by miR-221 precedes the induction of erythroid differentiation [6].

An array analysis of miRNA expression profiles in various cell lineages showed that the expression profile of miRNAs, rather than the specific miRNA, is important for cellular functions at a particular lineage and a particular differentiation stage [4] and [7]. To clarify the roles of miRNAs in erythropoiesis, four miRNAs were selected (miR-155, miR-221, miR-223, and miR-451) because their expression seems to be relevant to hematopoiesis [4], [5], [6], [8] and [9], and the expression levels were sequentially examined during the in vitro differentiation of purified human erythroid progenitors using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The results showed that there was a down-regulation of miR-155 and an up-regulation of miR-451 during human erythroid differentiation. These results suggest that an analysis of the miRNA expression patterns is therefore a relevant approach to understanding both normal and pathological erythropoiesis.

Method
Liquid cultures of human erythroid colony-forming cells. Erythroid colony-forming cells (ECFCs) were prepared as described previously [10] and [11]. Briefly, low-density mononuclear cells were obtained from normal, healthy volunteers, who provided informed consent. The experiment was approved by the Institutional Board for Human Research. After negative selection was performed using anti-CD3, CD11b, CD15 and CD45RA antibodies and immunomagnetic beads in Vario-MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA, USA), the remaining cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco medium (GIBCOBRL, GrandIsland, NY, USA) containing 15% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Melbourne, Australia), 15% pooled human AB serum, 2 U/mL recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO), 20 ng/mL recombinant human stem cell factor (rhSCF), 10 ng/mL recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3) (R and D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN USA), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (GIBCOBRL) at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% air in a high-humidity incubator for 12–14 days. On day 3, rhIL-3 was depleted from the medium. After incubation for an additional 3 days, ECFCs were obtained and used in the subsequent experiments. Viable cell numbers were counted using the trypan blue exclusion method. The cell counts were performed using a Bürker-Türk hemocytometer. A morphological analysis of cytospin preparations was done after Giemsa or benzidine staining. RhEPO was kindly provided by the Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan). RhSCF was kindly provided by the Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan).

Fractionation of blood cells. Heparinized peripheral blood was gently overlaid on the LSM lymphocyte separation medium with a specific gravity of 1.077 (Organon Teknika Co., Durham, NC) in a centrifugation tube. Blood cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the platelets were collected from the plasma on the top layer. Cells on the interface between the plasma and the LSM solution were collected as a cell fraction containing lymphocytes and monocytes. The cells between the LSM solution and the packed red blood cells were also collected. Granulocytes in this fraction were obtained after lysing the red blood cells with a lysing solution (Becton–Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Red blood cells were recovered from the packed red blood cell fraction at the bottom.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted from 2 × 105 viable cells of each sample, by using the phenol/chlorofolm method [12]. cDNAs were synthesized using the RNA PCR Kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan). For a quantitative analysis of each gene expression, the amplification of cDNAs by the qRT-PCR method was done using SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara), primers (c-kit: forward primer, 5′-CGTTGACTATCAGTTCAGCGAG-3′, reverse primer, 5′-GCAGCATTGACGTCAGAATTGG-3′, β-globin: forward primer, 5′-ACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGC-3′ , reverse primer, 5′-AGTGATGGGCCAGCACACAG-3′, β-actin: forward primer, 5′-AAGAGCTACGAGCTGCCTGA-3′, reverse primer, 5′-GGCAGTGATCTCCTTCTGCA-3′) with a Thermal Cycler Dice (Takara) according to the manufacturer’s protocol [13]. The amounts of c-kit and β-globin expression were normalized with the level of β-actin expression. The relative amounts of each gene expression was calculated against the amount on day 12 cultures and calculated using the comparative Ct (2−ΔΔCt) method. The experiments were carried out in tetraplicate.

Analysis of miRNA expression. Each sample containing 5 × 105 cells was sequentially obtained from the liquid cultures. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were suspended in RNAlater® (ABI), and were stocked at −20 °C. Small RNAs (<200 nt) were extracted from cell pellets using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (ABI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To analyze miRNAs in reticulocytes, small RNAs were extracted from red blood cells which contained 5 × 106 of reticulocytes, the same number as other cell fractions. The number of reticulocytes was measured by using a dye, new methylene blue (Muto Pure Chemical,Tokyo, Japan).

The expression of miR-155, miR-221, miR-223, miR-451, U6, and let-7a was measured by qRT-PCR. Briefly, miRNAs were transcribed to cDNAs using a High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (ABI). Looped RT-primers specific for each microRNA were purchased, and were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TaqMan® MicroRNA Assays Kit, ABI). For detecting miRNAs, amplification by real-time PCR was done using TaqMan MicroRNA Assay probe (ABI), Universal PCR Master Mix (ABI), and Thermal Cycler Dice (Takara). The relative amounts of each miRNA were calculated against the amount on day 12, and calculated using the comparative Ct (2−ΔΔCt) method. The experiments were carried out in triplicate.

Results
Proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells in the liquid culture
Purified ECFCs were suspended in the liquid cultures for 11 to 12 days with hematopoietic growth factors (SCF and IL-3 on days 0–3, SCF and Epo on days 3–12). Cell numbers in the liquid cultures increased almost 500-fold in the representative experiment shown in Fig. 1A. Morphological analysis of cells stained with Giemsa solutions showed that almost all of the cells were undifferentiated on day 5, and that 66–86% (n = 5) of cells were undifferentiated on day 7 ( Fig. 1B). These undifferentiated cells had giant nucleoli, basophilic cytoplasm with marked perinuclear halo, and several cytoplasmic buds ( Fig. 1C). Basophilic erythroblasts were the predominant cell type (58–67%) on days 8–9 ( Fig. 1C). Polychromatophilic erythroblasts appeared on days 8–9, and orthochromatophilic erythroblasts on days 10–11 ( Fig. 1B). Benzidine-positive cells appeared on day 5 ( Fig. 1B). Thereafter, benzidine-positive cells increased remarkably, reaching a peak (91% of the whole population) on day 12 ( Fig. 1B).

Expression of erythropoiesis-related genes
The expression of c-kit and β-globin genes as erythropoiesis-related genes and β-actin gene as an internal control were analyzed sequentially using qRT-PCR. The expression of c-kit peaked on day 7 (Fig. 2). The expression level decreased about 7-fold on day 13. The same experiment showed a dynamic increase in β-globin mRNA in cultured cells after day 7, which peaked on day 13 (Fig. 2).

Analysis of miRNA expression during erythroid differentiation
To evaluate the changes in RNA content during the erythroid differentiation process, U6 which is a short RNA with ubiquitous expression in cells of various lineages was analyzed. Fig. 3C shows a 6.4-fold decrease of U6 RNA during the culture period in the liquid culture system, reflecting of the loss of nucleic acids due to erythroid differentiation. Let-7a is another short RNA which is abundantly expressed in the cells [14]. The expression level of let-7a also decreased 4.6-fold from day 3 to day 12 (Fig. 3C). In this study, U6 was used as the normalizer for measuring the content of each miRNA.

The expression patterns of the four miRNAs in cells, obtained from a representative experiments are shown in Fig. 3. Analyses of the cell numbers and cellular morphology in the same experiment are shown in Fig. 1. Quantitative analyses by qRT-PCR showed a drastic decrease in miR-155 content in cells in the liquid culture systems, in comparison with other miRNAs. The expression level of miR-155 shown in Fig. 3-A decreased about 200-fold from day 3 to day 12. An almost 87.5% reduction of the expression level of miR-155 was observed between days 3 and 5. The cellular content of miR-221 was also down-regulated during the in vitro differentiation of erythroid cells ( Fig. 3B).The reduction of the expression during the culture period was about 20-fold after normalization with U6 as the internal control. The expression of miR-223 decreased as cell differentiated to mature erythroid cells, although the reduction of the expression was relatively small (10-fold) in comparison to miR-155 and miR-221 ( Fig. 3A and B).

In contrast to the down-regulation of miR-155, miR-221, miR-223, the expression levels of miR-451 increased 267-fold during the culture period (Fig. 3A). Since this increase was obtained after normalizing with the U6 expression level, this result demonstrates the real up-regulation of miR-451.

Expressions of miR-451 in mature blood cells
To further observe the up-regulation of miR-451 in mature erythroid cells in the liquid culture, the miR-451 level was analyzed in mature blood cells purified from normal human peripheral blood using a density centrifugation method. Morphological observation showed that the red blood cell fraction contained 100% of red blood cells, the granulocyte fraction: granulocytes 97%, lymphocytes 3%; the mononuclear cells fraction: lymphocytes 39.0%, monocytes 47.5%, platelets 50.0%, granulocytes 2.5%; and the platelet fraction: platelets 100%; respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, miR-451 was expressed in red blood cells about 104-fold more than in granulocytes, about 10-folds more than in platelets.

Discussion
Hematopoietic cells express miRNAs which are specific to their proliferation and differentiation [15]. Ramkissoon et al. reported different expression profiles of miR-142, miR-155, miR-181, and miR-223 between malignant hematopoietic cell lines and purified normal human B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, monocytic and granulocytic lineages [7]. Several reports suggest regulatory roles of miRNAs for human erythropoiesis. Felli et al. found that down-regulations of miR-221 and miR-222 result in erythroid differentiation of CD34-positive progenitors purified from human cord blood [6]. Array hybridization measurements done by Choong et al. indicated that many miRNAs are involved in human erythropoiesis and that analyses of miRNA profiles are essential for understanding the mechanisms of erythroid differentiation. Among the up-regulated miRNAs, miR-451 shows a remarkable increase in a cellular content during erythropoiesis [9], and is present in mature red blood cells [16].

To clarify the functions of miRNAs in normal human erythropoiesis, based on these previous reports miR-155, miR-221, miR-223 and miR-451 were selected, and their expression patterns were sequentially observed using qRT-PCR. One of characteristic features of erythroid differentiation is the disappearance of nucleic acids due to loss of the nucleus during the final stage. To analyze expression patterns of miRNAs, it was necessary to subtract the effects of the differentiation-associated reduction in RNA content. For this purpose, two short RNAs, U6 and let-7a were analyzed. U6 is a short RNA having 106 nucleotides, with ubiquitous expression in cells of various lineages [17]. Let-7a is one of the most abundant miRNAs in human tissues [14]. Since these observations showed that cellular levels of U6 RNAs decreased 6.4-fold during the erythroid differentiation (Fig. 3C), U6 expression was used as a normalizer for evaluating the expression levels of miRNAs.

MiR-155 was highly expressed in cells on day 3 (Fig. 3A), when the undifferentiated cells were predominant (Fig. 1B). After day 7, when mature erythroid cells appeared, a marked down-regulation of miR-155 was observed (Fig. 3A). Many reports show a close relationship between the expression of miR-155 and the proliferative potential of hematopoietic cells. For example, miR-155 is over-expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Burkett’s lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines [18], [19] and [20]. Down-regulation of miR-155 induces differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells [4]. Together with previous reports, the current observation suggests that miR-155 is an essential molecule to maintain undifferentiated eryhroid progenitor cells, and that down regulation of miR-155 is required for erythroid differentiation.

The present results showed that miR-221 and miR-223 were down-regulated during the erythroid differentiation process as well as miR-155, although the reduction of the expression levels was smaller than that of miR-155. Felli et al. demonstrated down-regulation of miR-221 and miR-222 during the early stage of erythroid differentiation, and suggested that down-regulation of miR-221 and miR-222 unblocks the suppression of c-kit protein production, resulting in erythroid maturation [6]. The current observations, using qRT-PCR, showed that a decrease in miR-221 preceded the peak of c-kit expression on day 7 ( Fig. 2). The down-regulation of miR-221 in differentiating erythroid cells was 22.3-fold which was smaller than of miR-155 (197-fold), and larger than of miR-223 (11.3-fold). These results suggest that miR-221 therefore plays a role in inducing erythroid differentiation.

MiR-223 was reported to control human granulocytic differentiation together with transcription factors NFI-A and C/EBPa which compete for binding to the miR-223 promoter. NFI-A maintains miR-223 expression at a low level, whereas replacement of NFI-A by C/EBPa upregulates miR-223 expression in retinoic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation [6]. In the current study, a reduction of miR-223 contents was detected in the erythroid cells, although the degree of the reduction was less obvious than miR-155 and miR-221. This result suggests that the expression of miR-223 is not limited to granulocytic differentiation, although the primary influence of miR-223 is on granulopoiesis.

In contrast to the observations of miR-155, miR-221 and miR-223, the current results showed a remarkable increase in the expression level of miR-451 during erythroid differentiation. The amount of miR-451 increased 267-fold. An increase in miR-451 levels was in parallel with the proportion of benzidine-positive cells (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3A). Zhan et al. reported up-regulation of miR-451 during terminal erythroid differentiation [9]. They examined the expression profiles of 295 miRNAs in the erythroid culture system by array hybridization and real-time PCR, and found that miR-451 showed the most remarkable increase in cellular content. Rathjen et al. demonstrated that human red blood cells contain an abundant amount of miR-451 [16]. The target molecule of miR-451 is not clear. Reticulocytes are young red blood cells, and contain many messenger RNAs [21]. Therefore, during the final stage of erythroid differentiation, important genes for red blood cell function are still actively transcribed. Some of those mRNAs may the target molecules of miR-451. The current results suggest that miR-451 may be measured as a marker molecule for evaluating normal or abnormal erythropoiesis.

Recent studies indicate that about 500 miRNAs are cooperate to regulate gene expression through suppressing translation of mRNAs or inducing instability of mRNAs [1], [2] and [15]. One miRNA has almost a hundred target genes. They represent a network system, together with the transcription factors, for regulating gene expression [3]. Since miRNAs are negative regulators in the gene-regulating network system, the down-regulation of miRNA unblocks the genes necessary for differentiation. On the other hand, the up-regulation of miRNA either blocks the genes necessary for proliferation or keeps the cells in an undifferentiated state. The findings of this study suggest that the regulation of miR-155 and miR-451 during erythropoiesis is differentiation-stage specific, and these two miRNAs are thus considered to be key molecules for the erythroid differentiation process.
