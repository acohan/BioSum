This approach results in the identifications of LAMC1 and ITGB1, and NFI-A as miR-124 and miR-223 targets, respectively [7] and [8]; Finally, a fluorescent protein-based transient reporter assay in vivo (TRA-In Vivo) has recently been developed and successfully utilized for miRNA target screen and validation in zebrafish embryos [9], [10] and [11] | Reference Offset:  ['21042-22340'] | Reference Text:  In order to validate the NFI-A mRNA as a possible miR-223 target, we set up an assay in which the 3'UTR of the NFI-A gene, including the putative miRNA target site, was inserted downstream of a luciferase ORF (3'NFI-Awt, Figure 4C). A construct containing a mutated sequence of the miRNA binding site, 3'NFI-Amut, was also produced as a control. The different luciferase constructs were transfected into NB4 cells with a plasmid carrying a constitutive-expression cassette for miR-223 (psiU-223, Figure 4D) or with the same vector expressing an unrelated 21 nucleotide RNA (psiU-control). In these experiments, we preferred utilizing a construct expressing miR-223 under a heterologous and constitutive promoter in order to have a constant level of expression. The ability of psiU-223 to direct the expression and processing of a mature miR-223 is shown ( Figure 4D). A specific negative effect on luciferase activity was observed in the presence of miR-223 on the wild-type substrate, while no reduction in luciferase activity was obtained when the target site was mutated ( Figure 4E). The decrease in luciferase activity was similar to the translational repressor effect observed for other miRNAs on their substrates ( Poy et al., 2004). These results indicated that NFI-A is a target of miR-223 | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Remarkably, one of the putative targets of miR-223 identified by computational analysis (Lewis et al., 2005 and Krek et al., 2005) is the transcription factor NFI-A, a CCAAT-related binding protein controlling genes involved in cell growth control, which has been shown to bind sequences related to the ones of C/EBPα (Gronostajski, 2000) ... One of the two C/EBPα binding elements in the miR-223 promoter overlaps with a NFI-A binding site (Meisterernst et al., 1988, Bachurski et al., 1997 and Gronostajski, 2000). Indeed, NFI-A was shown to interact with this sequence in vivo; nevertheless, its binding was released upon RA treatment and substituted by that of C/EBPα. This displacement correlated with miRNA transcriptional upregulation. Notably, in cells resistant to retinoic acid and unable to undergo differentiation, the NFI-A factor remained on the miRNA promoter and no C/EBPα binding was detected. These findings supported the hypothesis of a competition between the two proteins in the regulation of the miRNA promoter: NFI-A produces low levels of miR-223, while C/EBPα is the differentiation-specific activator | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

The miR-223 is evolutionarily conserved, and its expression pattern during myeloid differentiation is also similar in human and mouse systems. However, we did not find the unique C/EBPα-binding element that overlaps with NFI-A-binding site in mouse miR-223 gene, suggesting that the previously proposed machinery reported in human miR-223 regulation might not be a conserved mechanism of miR-223 regulation | Reference Offset:  ['2781-3213', '6224-6926', '31203-31475'] | Reference Text:  A recent study has identified three miRNAs preferentially expressed in murine hematopoietic tissues: miR-181, miR-142, and miR-223 (Chen et al., 2004). miR-181 is strongly expressed in the thymus, miR-142 in all hematopoietic tissues, and miR-223 in the bone marrow.

Among the hundreds of predicted regulatory targets of miR-223 (Lewis et al., 2005 and Krek et al., 2005), we noticed transcription factor NFI-A, a protein known to bind sequences related to the ones of C/EBPα (Gronostajski, 2000). Notably, a search in the miR-223 promoter revealed the presence of a NFI-A site (Meisterernst et al., 1988 and Garlatti et al., 1993) overlapping one of the two identified C/EBPα binding sites (see Figure 3) ... The NFI proteins bind as dimers to the dyad symmetric consensus sequence TTGGC(N5)GCCAA; nevertheless, they could also bind very well to individual half-sites, even though with a reduced affinity, and presumably as heterodimers with other proteins (Meisterernst et al., 1988 and Bachurski et al., 1997). Due to the ability to bind to half-sites, the NFI family could somehow compete with the C/EBP factors in binding the CCAAT element (Garlatti et al., 1993).

The two factors compete for binding to the miR-223 promoter: NFI-A maintains miR-223 at low levels, whereas its replacement by C/EBPα, following retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation, upregulates miR-223 expression. The competition by C/EBPα and the granulocytic differentiation are favored by a negative-feedback loop in which miR-223 represses NFI-A translation. In line with this, both RNAi against NFI-A and ectopic expression of miR-223 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells enhance differentiation, whereas miR-223 knockdown inhibits the differentiation response to RA. Altogether, our data indicate that miR-223 plays a crucial role during granulopoiesis and point to the NFI-A repression as an important molecular pathway mediating gene reprogramming in this cell lineage ... One of the two C/EBPα binding elements in the miR-223 promoter overlaps with a NFI-A binding site (Meisterernst et al., 1988, Bachurski et al., 1997 and Gronostajski, 2000). Indeed, NFI-A was shown to interact with this sequence in vivo; nevertheless, its binding was released upon RA treatment and substituted by that of C/EBPα. This displacement correlated with miRNA transcriptional upregulation. Notably, in cells resistant to retinoic acid and unable to undergo differentiation, the NFI-A factor remained on the miRNA promoter and no C/EBPα binding was detected. These findings supported the hypothesis of a competition between the two proteins in the regulation of the miRNA promoter: NFI-A produces low levels of miR-223, while C/EBPα is the differentiation-specific activator ... RNAi against NFI-A drastically increased the differentiation response of NB4 cells to RA, whereas the opposite effect was found with C/EBPα depletion. These findings are in agreement with the roles described for NFI-A and C/EBPα. C/EBPα has been implicated in promoting differentiation and repressing genes that play the important function of promoting growth (McKnight, 2001 and Tenen, 2001). On the other hand, NFI-A has been implicated in replication as well as in controlling changes in cell growth (Gronostajski, 2000) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Study of miR-223 expression disclosed a very interesting regulatory loop involving two well-known transcriptional factors, C/EBPα and NFI-A (see model in Figure 7). C/EBPα was shown to interact with the miR-223 promoter region required for RA responsiveness, and its binding correlated perfectly in time with the start of miRNA induction ... The regulatory circuitry described here provides another example of how gene reprogramming during differentiation relies on fine modulation of gene expression.
