A construct containing a mutated sequence of the miRNA binding site, 3′NFI-Amut, was also produced as a control ... A specific negative effect on luciferase activity was observed in the presence of miR-223 on the wild-type substrate, while no reduction in luciferase activity was obtained when the target site was mutated ( Figure 4E). The decrease in luciferase activity was similar to the translational repressor effect observed for other miRNAs on their substrates ( Poy et al., 2004).

We next investigated whether C/EBPα physically interacts with the miR-223 promoter and whether its binding correlates with miR-223 transcriptional upregulation. This association was analyzed in vivo during RA-induced granulopoiesis of NB4 and RA-resistant NB4 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (Figure 3). Cells were treated with RA for 4, 24, 48, and 72 hr, and chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with an anti-C/EBPα antibody. DNA from the immunoprecipitates was then amplified by PCR using primers (Oligos#1) located in the promoter region close to the putative C/EBPα binding sites (see schematic representation in Figure 3). C/EBPα was found associated with this region after 24, 48, and 72 hr of RA induction in NB4 cells (lanes NB4 24, 48, and 72), whereas no reactivity was measurable in untreated cells (lane 0) or after 4 hr of RA treatment (lane 4).

In order to validate the NFI-A mRNA as a possible miR-223 target, we set up an assay in which the 3′UTR of the NFI-A gene, including the putative miRNA target site, was inserted downstream of a luciferase ORF (3′NFI-Awt, Figure 4C). A construct containing a mutated sequence of the miRNA binding site, 3′NFI-Amut, was also produced as a control. The different luciferase constructs were transfected into NB4 cells with a plasmid carrying a constitutive-expression cassette for miR-223 (psiU-223, Figure 4D) or with the same vector expressing an unrelated 21 nucleotide RNA (psiU-control). In these experiments, we preferred utilizing a construct expressing miR-223 under a heterologous and constitutive promoter in order to have a constant level of expression. The ability of psiU-223 to direct the expression and processing of a mature miR-223 is shown ( Figure 4D). A specific negative effect on luciferase activity was observed in the presence of miR-223 on the wild-type substrate, while no reduction in luciferase activity was obtained when the target site was mutated ( Figure 4E). The decrease in luciferase activity was similar to the translational repressor effect observed for other miRNAs on their substrates ( Poy et al., 2004). These results indicated that NFI-A is a target of miR-223 ... miR-223 activation correlated in time with the decrease in accumulation of the NFI-A protein, while its mRNA levels remained unaltered; this, together with the experimental validation of the bona fide target site in the 3′UTR, indicated that NFI-A is a target of miR-223 | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |
