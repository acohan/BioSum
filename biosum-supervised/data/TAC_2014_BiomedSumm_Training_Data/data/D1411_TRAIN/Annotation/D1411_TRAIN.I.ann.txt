A Model Summarizing the Interplay among miR-223, NFI-A, and C/EBPα in RA-Induced Granulocytic Differentiation. In undifferentiated NB4 cells (left panel), NFI-A binds the miR-223 promoter, keeping levels of miR-223 expression and consequently miR-223-mediated translational repression low. Upon RA treatment (right panel), C/EBPα replaces NFI-A on the miR-223 promoter and boosts miR-223 expression. This results in an increase of miR-223-mediated translational repression of the NFI-A mRNA and decrease of the NFI-A protein | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  I, |
