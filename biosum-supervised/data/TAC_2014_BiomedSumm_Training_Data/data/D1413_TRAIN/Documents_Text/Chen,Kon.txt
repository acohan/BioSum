ARF stabilization is critical for p53-mediated apoptosis upon Myc overexpression
Summary
ARF suppresses aberrant cell growth upon c-Myc overexpression by activating p53 responses. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which ARF specifically restrains the oncogenic potential of c-Myc without affecting its normal physiological function is not well understood. Here, we show that low levels of c-Myc expression stimulate cell proliferation, whereas high levels inhibit by activating the ARF/p53 response. Although the mRNA levels of ARF are induced in both scenarios, the accumulation of ARF protein occurs only when ULF-mediated degradation of ARF is inhibited by c-Myc overexpression. Moreover, the levels of ARF are reduced through ULF-mediated ubiquitination upon DNA damage. Blocking ARF degradation by c-Myc overexpression dramatically stimulates the apoptotic responses. Our study reveals that ARF stability control is crucial for differentiating normal (low) versus oncogenic (high) levels of c-Myc expression and suggests that differential effects on ULF- mediated ARF ubiquitination by c-Myc levels act as a barrier in oncogene-induced stress responses.

Introduction
ARF (known as p14ARF in human and p19ARF in mouse) was identified initially as the product of an alternative reading frame of the Ink4a/ARF tumor suppressor locus (Sherr 2001; Sharpless and DePinho 2004). One of the major functions of ARF is to activate the p53 pathway by inhibiting the E3 ligase activity of either Mdm2 or ARF-BP1 to degrade p53 (Pomerantz et al., 1998; Kamijo et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2005; Kon et al., 2012). ARF does, however, also function to inhibit cell growth in a p53-independent manner (Kuo et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2005). The molecular dissection of ARF regulation was focused on its transcriptional levels. As reported in numerous studies, transcription of ARF is induced by oncogenes, such as Myc, Ras, E2F1, and E1A, and repressed upon overexpression of Rb-E2F complexes, Twist, Bim1, and certain T-box factors ( Sherr, 2006). Recent studies indicate that ARF polypeptides are degraded by the ubiquitination pathway ( Kuo et al., 2004); subsequently, ULF has been identified as the specific E3 ubiquitin ligase for ARF turnover ( Chen et al., 2010a). Interestingly, several cellular factors, such as c-Myc and NPM or the potential tumor suppressor TRADD, have been found to play critical roles in tumorigenesis, at least in part by regulating ULF-mediated ARF ubiquitination ( Chen et al., 2010a; Chio et al., 2012).

c-Myc is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor driving a range of cellular responses depending on the cellular context (Dang et al., 2006; Zeller et al., 2003). In normal cells, both messenger RNA (mRNA) level and protein expression of c-Myc are low, whereas cells stimulated by growth factor can have a relatively high amount of c-Myc (Liu and Levens, 2006; Rabbitts et al., 1985; Ramsay et al., 1984). In most human cancers, however, c-Myc expression is deregulated and/or significantly increased. c-Myc was first identified as an oncogene, since supraphysiological levels of Myc promote cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, and cell transformation. Notably, inactivation of the c-myc gene leads to embryonic lethality and significantly impairs normal development and cell growth, implicating a normal physiological role for c-Myc in vivo ( Mateyak et al., 1997; Baudino et al., 2002). On the other hand, overexpression of Myc engages the ARF/p53 tumor suppressor pathway and apoptosis, which inhibit cell growth and restrict Myc’s oncogenic potential. Myc’s paradoxical properties have been further supported in recent studies ( Murphy et al., 2008; Tran et al., 2008), reporting that low-level deregulated c-Myc may be a more efficient initiator of oncogenesis than overexpressed c-Myc, since the latter can be bypassed only in the cells where the ARF/p53 pathways are disabled. Indeed, high initial levels of Myc can prolong the mean latency and delay tumor onset in a transgenic RasG12D lung tumor model ( Tran et al., 2008). Thus, the precise mechanism by which ARF specifically restrains the oncogenic potential of c-Myc without affecting its normal physiological function is a critical issue that needs to be further elucidated. Here, we show that low levels of c-Myc expression can promote cell growth and only induce ARF transcription without significantly elevating its protein levels. In contrast, high levels of c-Myc overexpression not only induce ARF transcription, but also stabilize ARF by inhibiting ULF activity, which subsequently leads to p53 activation and suppression of c-Myc oncogenic activity. Moreover, ARF is degraded by ULF upon DNA damage; this degradation can be inhibited by c-Myc overexpression, which dramatically sensitizes the cells to p53-mediated apoptosis.

Results
Different Levels of c-Myc Expression Have Opposite Effects on Cell Growth Due To its Distinct Effects on the Interaction between ULF and ARF
Previous studies suggest that low levels of deregulated c-Myc may be a more efficient initiator of oncogenesis, since overexpressed c-Myc may breach the ARF/apoptotic threshold and engage intrinsic tumor suppression (Murphy et al., 2008; Tran et al., 2008). Accordingly, we infected normal human fibroblast cells (NHF-1) with c-Myc recombinant adenovirus at different multiplicities of infection (moi) for 36 hr. NHF-1 cells infected by low levels of adenovirus (Ad)-Myc (moi 10) grew faster than those infected with Ad-control, while a slower growth was observed at high levels of Ad-Myc (moi 50) (Figure 1A). By monitoring 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (Figure 1B), we confirmed that low levels of c-Myc promote, whereas high levels of c-Myc inhibit, the growth of NHF-1 cells. To further analyze the relationship between cell growth and c-Myc expression in NHF-1 cells, we first examined the ARF mRNA level as well as protein expression in those cells. As shown in Figure 1C, a low amount of c-Myc significantly induced ARF mRNA level but did not result in accumulation of ARF protein (lane 2 versus lane 1; also see Figure S1 available online), which only increased in the presence of high Myc expression (lane 3 versus lane 1). Consistently, p53 and its downstream targets p21, PUMA, and Bax were activated by high expression of c-Myc ( Figure 1C, lane 3 versus lane 1) but not by a low level of c-Myc (lane 2 versus lane 1). Thus, it appears that ARF protein elevation is mainly due to posttranslational modification. To examine whether the cell growth inhibition induced by high levels of Myc expression is ARF dependent, we treated the cells (NHF-1) with either control RNAi or ARF-RNAi and then infected them with high levels of Ad-Myc (moi 50). As shown in Figure 1D, inactivation of ARF expression by RNAi-mediated knockdown completely reversed the cell growth repression induced by high levels of c-Myc expression.

We showed previously that overexpression of c-Myc can block the interaction between ARF and ULF and mediates transcription-independent ARF upregulation (Chen et al., 2010a). It is reasonable to speculate that Myc levels have to reach the certain threshold to efficiently block the interaction between ARF and ULF. To test this hypothesis, we transfected the expression vectors of ARF, ULF, and Myc in 293T cells. As expected, higher expression of c-Myc blocked the ULF and ARF interaction (Figure 2A, lane 8 versus lane 6), but lower levels of Myc failed to do so (lane 7 versus lane 6). Furthermore, higher, but not lower, expression of Myc prevented ARF ubiquitination mediated by ULF (Figure 2B, lane 4 versus lane 3). Together, these results indicate that in contrast to high levels of Myc expression, low levels of Myc (below the threshold) are not capable of abrogating the interaction between ULF and ARF, inhibiting ARF ubiquitination by ULF and stabilizing ARF.

ARF Is Degraded upon DNA Damage in Normal Human Fibroblast Cells
p53-mediated apoptosis is well documented in most of the cells expressing wild-type p53; nevertheless, normal human fibroblasts are not sensitive to DNA damage-induced apoptosis unless in the presence of high levels of c-Myc expression. To further ascertain the functional outcomes at different levels of Myc expression under cellular stress, we treated the normal human fibroblast cells with doxorubicin for 24 hr after adenovirus infection of c-Myc. As shown in Figure 2C, high levels of c-Myc expression dramatically induced apoptosis after DNA damage (83%), while control virus or low levels of Myc showed much less DNA damage-induced apoptosis (about 20% or less) (also see Figure S2A). Notably, there was a modest increase in cell death observed in the cells with high levels of Myc expression in the absence of doxorubicin treatment; however, the apoptotic response was much weaker compared to the same cells under the DNA damage condition (Figure 2C). Thus, the cell growth repression induced by high levels of Myc is probably caused by both inhibition of cell proliferation and low levels of apoptosis. Moreover, we examined whether the apoptotic response of these cells under DNA damage conditions is ARF dependent. As shown in Figure 2D, RNAi-mediated knockdown of ARF significantly abrogated the apoptotic response induced by high levels of c-Myc expression upon DNA damage (also see Figure S2B). Thus, these data demonstrate that both cell growth repression and DNA damage-induced apoptosis enhanced by high levels of c-Myc expression are ARF dependent.

Our studies consistently show that c-Myc-mediated upregulation of ARF acts through both transcription-dependent and transcription-independent mechanisms (Chen et al., 2010a). It is very likely that ARF stabilization induced by high levels of Myc modulates the sensitivity of these cells to p53-mediated apoptosis. Although p53 activation is well documented in DNA damage responses, the role of ARF in p53 regulation upon DNA damage is not well understood in normal cells (Lo and Lu, 2010; Kovi et al., 2010; di Tommaso et al., 2009; Itahana et al., 2008; Tompkins et al., 2007).

In this regard, we treated the normal human fibroblast cells with doxorubicin and harvested the cells at different time points. As expected, p53 was stabilized upon the doxorubicin treatment and p21 was activated through p53-mediated transcriptional upregulation (Figure 3A, lanes 1–6). Interestingly, the levels of ARF protein gradually decreased at each time point and almost disappeared at 24 hr. Notably, the mRNA levels of ARF were only slightly reduced, possibly due to repression by p53 activation (also see Figure S3A) ( Zeng et al., 2011). Those results indicate that the reduced total ARF proteins were mainly caused by degradation, which was completely inhibited in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, epoxomycin ( Figure 3A, lanes 7 and 8). Similar results were also obtained when the cells were treated with other DNA damaging agents such as etoposide or ionizing irradiation ( Figure 3B). In addition, the decreased half-life of ARF was observed after doxorubicin treatment ( Figures 3C and S3B). To further confirm these observations, we performed the same treatment in IMR-90, another normal human fibroblast cell line. Again, in contrast to p53, the levels of ARF were dramatically reduced in these cells upon the treatment of doxorubicin ( Figure 3D). Together, these data demonstrate that ARF is degraded upon DNA damage in normal human fibroblast cells.

ULF Plays an Important Role in DNA Damage-Mediated Apoptotic Responses in Normal Human Cells
To examine the role of ULF in ARF degradation mediated by DNA damage, we tested whether knockdown of ULF can affect ARF levels. As shown in Figure 4A, ULF knockdown significantly increased the levels of ARF and enhanced the steady-state levels of p53 and its targets p21 and PUMA (Figure 4A, lanes 5–8 versus lanes 1–4; also see Figure S4A). To avoid potential off-target effects by RNAi-mediated knockdown, we used two additional RNAi oligos against ULF in the same assays and obtained similar results (Figures S4B and S4C). These data suggest that ULF, at least in part, contributes to ARF degradation during the cellular response to the doxorubicin treatment. To further investigate the functional consequence of ULF-mediated degradation of ARF in DNA damage responses, we examined the effects of ULF knockdown in p53-mediated apoptosis. Although p53-mediated apoptosis is well demonstrated in many cell types, it is commonly observed that most of the normal cells, such as normal human fibroblasts, are resistant to p53-mediated apoptosis upon DNA damage. As expected, ULF knockdown elevated the levels of p53, but this regulation was diminished upon codepletion of both ULF and ARF (Figure 4B). Moreover, only a very small portion of apoptotic cells was detected in these NHF-1 cells after doxorubicin treatment; however, ULF knockdown cells showed dramatically elevated levels of apoptosis (Figure 4C). To further elucidate whether DNA damage-induced apoptosis mediated by ARF stabilization is both ARF and p53 dependent, we examined the apoptotic responses in ARF-depleted or p53-depleted cells. As shown in Figure 4C, in contrast to high levels of DNA damage-induced apoptosis by ULF knockdown, the apoptosis activities were markedly diminished in NHF-1 cells upon small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of both ULF and ARF or codepletion of ULF and p53. Taken together, these data suggest that ARF stabilization by ULF knockdown significantly sensitizes the cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis and that the apoptotic responses are both ARF and p53 dependent. Interestingly, the levels of cell death induced by c-Myc overexpression (Figure 2D) are much higher than the levels in ULF knockdown cells (Figure 4C), raising an interesting issue: the apoptotic effect of c-Myc overexpression may also act through other unknown mechanisms that need future investigation.

ARF Stabilization Is Crucial for Apoptotic Responses in MEFs
To further elucidate the role of ULF-mediated degradation of ARF in DNA damage responses, we tested whether ULF was also involved in the degradation of mouse ARF protein (p19) in primary mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. As shown in Figure 5A, the levels of p19 were indeed increased upon ULF knockdown, suggesting that ULF is also responsible for ARF degradation in these primary MEFs. Notably, the ARF level also decreased significantly in response to the treatment of doxorubicin (Figure 5B).

To explore the role of ULF in the regulation of ARF stability under more physiological settings, we generated ULF knockout cells. To circumvent the embryonic lethality of ulf conventional knockout mice ( Kajiro et al., 2011), we designed a conditional knockout allele of ulf, in which exon 5 (total of 41 exons, ensemble) is flanked by LoxP sites (floxed) to permit deletion of exon 5 upon Cre expression ( Figure S5A). Deletion of exon 5 causes a reading frameshift and results in loss of the majority of ULF protein. A total of 34 targeted clones were obtained from 200 embryonic stem cell (ESC) clones screened by Southern blot ( Figure S5B). Two independent clones were injected into blastocysts to achieve germline transmission of the conditional knockout allele. The ulffl/+ mice were intercrossed to generate ulf conditional knockout homozygous mice (ulffl/fl), and their progenies were genotyped by PCR ( Figure S5C). Both ulffl/+ and ulffl/fl were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, suggesting that floxing exon 5 of ulf did not cause any noticeable changes in ulf expression. In order to undergo Cre-mediated deletion of the floxed ulf allele, ulf conditional knockout MEFs from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) embryos were transduced with Ad-CMV-Cre (moi 200, Vector BioLabs) for 2 days. As shown in Figure 5C, ULF protein was nearly depleted in ulffl/fl after Ad-Cre virus infection (lane 3 versus lane 1). Significantly, ARF was accumulated in ulf knockout MEFs, which led to activation of p53 and its target (p21) and apoptotic genes Bax and caspase-3. Notably, after additional doxorubicin treatment for 16 hr, ARF degradation was significantly attenuated in ulf knockout MEFs, which resulted in more sensitive responses of p53 and its targets upon DNA damage ( Figure 5C, lane 4 versus lane 2). These data strongly support the notion that ULF contributes to ARF degradation in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, we examined the effects of p53-mediated apoptosis under DNA damage. As expected, no significant number of apoptotic cells was observed in these MEFs infected with Ad-GFP virus after doxorubicin treatment, whereas a high percentage of apoptotic cells was found in ulf knockout MEFs with the same treatment ( Figure 5D). Finally, we examined the apoptotic responses in wild-type MEFs, ARF null MEFs, and p53 null MEFs. As shown in Figure 5E, RNAi-mediated ULF knockdown induced high levels of the apoptotic responses in wild-type MEFs upon DNA damage. However, the apoptotic activities were largely abolished in either ARF null MEFs or p53 null MEFs under the same conditions. Taken together, these data further support the notion that ARF stabilization is critical for DNA damage-mediated apoptotic responses and that the apoptotic responses observed here are both ARF and p53 dependent.

Suppression of ULF-Mediated ARF Degradation by Myc Overexpression Is Critical for DNA Damage-Induced Apoptosis in MEFs
We previously identified a transcription-defective mutant, MycΔBR, that can still interact with ULF and inhibit its ability to degrade ARF (Figure 6A). To further examine whether Myc-mediated ARF stabilization contributes to p53-dependent apoptosis, we infected primary MEFs with the adenovirus expressing the MycΔBR protein or control virus for 48 hr, followed by doxorubicin treatment for 24 hr. As expected ARF levels were higher in MEFs infected with Ad-MycΔBR than in the control cells (Figure 6B, lane 3 versus lane 1). Moreover, ARF remained higher in Ad-MycΔBR-infected MEFs, whereas it decreased in the control cells upon doxorubicin treatment (Figure 6B, lane 4 versus lane 2). It is well known that p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest is easily detected in primary MEFs, but these cells are resistant to p53-mediated apoptosis upon DNA damage. Notably, upon overexpression of oncoproteins such c-Myc, the oncogene-transformed MEFs are highly sensitive to p53-induced apoptosis (Eischen et al., 1999; Zindy et al., 1998; Naik et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2000; Saporita et al., 2007). We then counted the apoptotic cells for the above MEFs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) according to sub-G1 peaks on a DNA content histogram. As shown in Figure 6C, no significant apoptosis was found in control virus-infected cells after doxorubicin treatment. However, a large portion of the Ad-MycΔBR-infected MEFs became apoptotic upon the same treatment (47%), very close to the levels in the Ad-Myc (WT)-infected MEFs (∼65%). Together, these data demonstrated that ARF stabilization by c-Myc plays a key role in sensitizing the c-Myc transformed cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis.

Discussion
Cell proliferation and cell death are the opposite cellular fates; however, the two are linked and interdependent processes (Lowe et al., 2004). This phenomenon is exemplified by the Myc protein (Evan and Vousden, 2001). Besides its growth-promoting ability, Myc was found to be a powerful trigger of apoptosis, mainly through the ARF/p53 pathway and particularly under conditions of stress, genotoxic damage, or depleted survival factors. How different threshold levels of Myc might favorably induce proliferation or apoptosis is still unknown. Our studies uncover an important mechanism of different thresholds to determine Myc’s distinctive biological outcomes. Low levels of Myc can promote cell proliferation and activate ARF transcription but do not cause accumulation of ARF protein or activation of p53 activity. High expression of Myc not only activates ARF transcription but also stabilizes ARF protein by disrupting the binding between ARF and its E3 ligase, ULF, activates the p53 pathway, and induces cell apoptosis.

Deciphering the intercorrelations between the ARF/p53 pathway and DNA damage signaling pathways is very important (Sherr, 2006; Vousden and Lane, 2007). A general view is that ARF is not directly induced by DNA damage such as genotoxic drugs, radiation, and hypoxia (Ozenne et al., 2010). Rather, ARF is repressed by the activated p53 upon DNA damage in normal cells (Zeng et al., 2011). In addition to transcription regulation, our results demonstrate that ARF becomes more unstable upon DNA damage due to ULF-mediated degradation. Interestingly, we revealed that blocking ARF degradation by ULF inactivation or Myc expression dramatically stimulates the apoptotic responses (Figure 7). Our findings uncover a unique aspect of DNA damage-induced regulation of the ARF/p53 pathway. More importantly, we found that modulation of ARF stability clearly affects p53-dependent apoptosis function and potentially regulates its tumor suppressor activity in vivo. The molecular mechanism by which the ARF-ULF interplay is regulated during DNA damage responses is very important and warrants future investigations. Protein modifications of p53 and Mdm2, such as phosphorylation, are well accepted as the key mechanisms for p53 stability control during DNA damage responses. Interestingly, a phosphorylated peptide-derived ULF was identified as an ATM/ATR substrate (in the supplemental data of Matsuoka et al., 2007). Thus, it is possible that ULF is phosphorylated by ATM/ATR and functionally regulated by phosphorylation during the DNA damage response.

Restoration of p53 activity remains an important goal in the quest for more effective cancer therapies. For example, since Mdm2 is overexpressed in human tumors that retain wild-type p53, reactivating wild-type p53 functionality by targeting Mdm2 holds promise to reinstate the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Indeed Nutlin-3, a small-molecule inhibitor of Mdm2, is able to activate p53 and exhibits antitumor efficacy in cancer cells that express high levels of Mdm2 (Vassilev, 2007). Interestingly, although p53 is mutated in more than 50% of human tumors, such as colon cancer and lung cancer, p53 gene mutations are found in less than 10% of de novo AML (acute myeloid leukemia); deletion or mutation of the ARF gene in AML is also very rare, suggesting that the p53/ARF pathway may be inactivated through different mechanisms (Renneville et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2010; Andersson et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2010b). Indeed, according to the data deposited in the AML gene expression profile database from Oncomine Research, the mRNA levels of ULF are significantly high in human AML cancer samples (Figueroa et al., 2010). It is likely that high levels of ULF expression are involved in inactivation of the ARF/p53 pathway in human AML. Our study demonstrates that blocking ARF degradation can significantly enhance p53 activation and induce p53-mediated apoptosis. Thus, targeting ULF with small-molecule inhibitors might offer a unique cancer therapy in certain types of human tumors that retain wild-type of p53 and ARF, such as AML.

Although the role of c-Myc in tumorigenesis is well accepted, the molecular mechanism by which c-Myc promotes normal cell growth and transformation in normal versus tumor cells is not well understood. c-Myc−/− mice die by E10.5, with defects in growth and in cardiac and neural development ( Baudino et al., 2002). By using gene-targeted disruption approaches, rat fibroblast cell lines with somatic c-Myc gene knockout were found viable ( Mateyak et al., 1997), but loss of c-Myc expression had profound effects on growth rate, cellular morphology, and cell cycle progression. These data demonstrate that c-Myc is absolutely required for cells to retain normal physiological activities. Thus, the precise mechanism by which the cell specifically restrains the oncogenic potential of c-Myc, without affecting its normal physiological function, is extremely important. Based on our results, the levels of Myc expression are critical to trigger ARF stabilization, and only high levels of c-Myc suppress cell proliferation and sensitize the cells to apoptosis upon DNA damage ( Figure 7) and, potentially, other types of stress. Thus, ARF stability control is crucial for differentiating normal (low) versus oncogenic (high) levels of Myc expression. It is very likely that Myc-mediated ARF stabilization acts as a barrier in oncogene-induced stress responses.

Experimental Procedures
siRNA-Mediated Ablation of ULF, ARF, and p53
Depletion of ULF was done by transfection of the NHF-1 cells with siRNA duplex oligonucleotides (ULF-RNAi-#1 [5′-GGUAGUGACUCCACCCAUUUU-3′], ULF-RNAi-#2 [5′-GAACACAGAUGGUGCGAUAUU-3′], ULF-RNAi-#3 [5′-GACAAAGACUCAUACAAUAUU-3′]) synthesized by Dharmacon. ULF RNAi oligo#1 was always used unless specified. p14ARF RNAi (5′-GAUCAUCAGUCACCGAAGGUU-3′; Dharmacon), p53 RNAi (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool L-003329-00; Dharmacon), and control RNAi (ON-TARGETplus siControl nontargeting pool D-001810-10-20; Dharmacon) were used for transfection. RNAi transfections were performed at 24–48 hr intervals with Oligofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Lentiviral Infections
GIPZ Lentiviral shRNAmir vectors for ULF and control were from Open Biosystems. Lentiviral solution was produced by cotransfecting the lentiviral vectors, the packaging vector Delta 8.9, and the pMD.G plasmid as previously described (Chen et al., 2010b). For infection, primary MEFs were incubated with viral supernatants and supplemented with 5 μg/ml polybrene overnight. The lentiviral-infected primary MEFs were selected with puromycin.

Adenovirus Infection
The construct for Ad-c-Myc and c-Myc-ΔBR was described previously (Chen et al., 2010a). Adenoviruses were produced following the manual of the AdEasy Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene). After one round of amplification in Ad-293T cells, the viruses were used to infect NHF-1 cells or p1 primary MEFs at 70% confluence.

Generation of ULF-Deficient MEFs
The mouse ulf gene contains 41 exons spanning a 100 kb genomic DNA region. To avoid potential lethality in ulf conventional knockout mice, a conditional knockout strategy was designed to delete exon 5 (ensemble) by flanking exon 5 with LoxP sites (floxing exon 5). Deletion of exon 5 causes translational reading frameshift, resulting in C-terminal truncation of the protein, including the HECT domain. Briefly, the genomic DNA of the targeting region was cloned from BAC bMQ-374G10 (Geneservice) using recombination-mediated genetic engineering (recombineering). The first loxP site, along with an NcoI site, was inserted into intron 4, and a neomycin (neo) cassette and the second LoxP cassette were inserted into intron 5. The targeting vector was electroporated into ESCs. The targeted ESC clones were screened by Southern blot using a 5′ external probe outside the 5′ targeting region. The targeted ESC clones have an additional 12 kb mutant NcoI band, compared to wild-type ESC clones, which have only the 21 kb NcoI band. A total of 34 targeted clones were obtained from 200 ESC clones screened. Two of the clones were injected into blastocysts to embryonically derive chimera, from which the germline transmission of the conditional knockout allele was accomplished. Genotyping was done by PCR using primer 1 (GCCTTTGTCTATTGTCTATGTTTG) and primer 2 (CCCTCTGAAAGTAG TACATGTATG) to detect the wild-type allele and primer 2 and primer 3 (GGAACTTCATCAGTCAGGTAC) for the floxed allele simultaneously to identify wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice. The ulffl/+ mice were intercrossed to generate ulf conditional knockout homozygote mice (ulffl/fl). Both ulffl/+ and ulffl/fl are indistinguishable from wild-type littermate, suggesting that floxing exon 5 of ulf did not cause noticeable effects on ulf expression. Subsequently, ulf conditional knockout MEFs from E13.5 embryos were transduced with Ad-CMV-Cre (Vector BioLabs) for 3 days in order to undergo Cre-mediated deletion of the floxed ulf allele. The elimination of ULF protein in MEFs was confirmed by immunoblotting as described above. All animal experiments were approved by the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) at Columbia University Health Sciences Center under the supervision of the Institute of Comparative Medicine.

Preparation of MEFs
ARF null mice were kindly provide by Dr. Charles J. Sherr’s lab (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN), and p53 null mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. All MEFs of wild-type or knockout mice were prepared from E13.5 embryos and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS.

Antibodies
To prepare the ULF antiserum, DNA sequences corresponding to 150 amino acids of ULF (residues 609–834) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-2T (5). α-ULF antiserum was raised in rabbits against the purified GST-ULF (651–800) fusion protein (Covance) and further affinity purified on the antigen column. Rabbit polyclonal p14ARF (A300–340A) was from Bethyl Laboratories. Human p53-specific monoclonal (DO-1), anti-NPM (H106) polyclonal, anti-p21 (C-19) polyclonal, anti-nucleolin (C-23), anti-p16 (C-20) polyclonal and (F4) monoclonal, and rat anti-ARF (5-C3-1) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-mouse p53 (CM5) polyclonal was from Leica Microsystems. Anti-PUMA polyclonal antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology.

Cell Culture
NHF-1 and IMR-90 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. H1299 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS.

RT-PCR analysis
TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen) were used to isolate total RNA from cells. By using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) with the oligo-dT primer, first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA. To amplify and analyze the prepared cDNA samples by PCR, the following primers were used in the PCR reaction: human p14ARF (forward): 5′GTGCGCAGGTTCTTGGTGACC; human p14ARF (reverse): 5′CTGCCCGTGGACCTGGCTGA; mouse p19ARF (forward): 5′ATGGG-TCGCAGGTTCTTGGTCACTGTGAGG; mouse p19ARF (reverse): 5′CTATGCCCCTCGGTCTGGGCGACGTTCCCA; human ULF (forward): GAAGTTTACCTCATTCCCACA; ULF (reverse): AACCGAGAGGAGCTGCTGAAA; human Nucleolin (forward): GGTGACCCCAAGAAAATGGCTCC; Nucleolin (reverse): GCTTCTTCTTCAGAGTCATCTTC; GAPDH (forward): 5′GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT; GAPDH (reverse): 5′GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Extracted RNAs were treated with DNA-free (Ambion) as per the manufacturer’s protocol before reverse transcription. The resulting cDNAs were diluted 1:10 and served as templates for quantitative real-time PCR reactions using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The PCR reaction mixtures were preincubated at 50°C for 2 min followed by denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 1 min using TaqMan real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using the SDS software provided by Applied Biosystems. Primer sequences were as follows: p14ARF-fwd: 5′GCAGCCGCTTCCTAGAAG-3′; p14ARF-rev: 5′CACGGGTCGGGTGAGAGT-3′; p19ARF-fwd: 5′AGGCTAGAGAGGATCTTGAG3′; p19ARF-rev: 5′TCCTCGCAGTTCGAATCTGC′. Each sample was assessed in triplicate. Relative mRNA levels were normalized to the actin gene and calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method.

Western Blot
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with fresh protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture [Sigma] and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]). Aliquots (20 μg) of cell extracts were resolved in Norvex 4%–20% Tris-Glycine Gel (invitrogen) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol. Membranes were blocked with 5% (v/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST; 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 0.1% Tween 20,137 mM NaCl), incubated with primary antibodies, then secondary antibodies, and detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences).

Flow Cytometry
After ULF-depleted NHF-1 cells or adenovirus-infected primary MEFs with 0.2 mg/ml doxorubicin treatment for 24 hr, the cells were seeded in fresh medium for an additional 24 hr. Cells were trypsinized and fixed in 70% ethanol, and DNA was then stained with propidium iodide (PI). Samples of 20,000 cells were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and the DNA histogram data were analyzed using CellQuest Software (Becton Dickinson) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The FACS analysis data depict mean of three experiments with SD indicated.

BrdU Labeling
The BrdU incorporation assay was performed as previously described with some modification (Chen et al., 2010a). NHF-1 cells were replaced with normal medium for 36 hr of additional culture after 36 hr of Ad-Myc infection. After being replated in the coverslips for 24 hr, NHF-1 cells were grown in medium containing 20 μM BrdU (Calbiochem) for 3 hr and then fixed in 70% ethanol at 4°C for 30 min. After being permeabilized in 2 N HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), the cells were neutralized in 0.1 M Na2B4O7 (pH 8.5) and then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. BrdU antibody was added following the manufacture’s protocol (Roche). After washing with 1% BSA/PBS four times, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 Conjugated Anti-Mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Lastly, cells were counterstained with DAPI to visualize the nuclei.
