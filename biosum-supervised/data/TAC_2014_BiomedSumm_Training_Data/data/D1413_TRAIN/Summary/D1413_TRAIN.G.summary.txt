The manuscript by Figueroa et al. 2010 describes the investigation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) and alpha ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme (TET2) mutations on DNA methylation in acute myeloid leukemia (APL) cell differentiation. This study used specimens from a total of 398 patients with AML and high throughput screening to resequence IDH1 and IDH2 to identify mutations in the study population. DNA methylation profiling was processed in all samples using the HELP assay (HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation mediated PCR).  A heatmap was generated to determine IDH1/2 mutant methylation profiles. Correlations were made between gene expression and 5-methylcytosine levels to make conclusions about methylation. The final conclusion is that IDH1/2 and TET2 mutations are mutually exclusive and both cause global DNA hypermethylation. The following results were referred to: IDH1 mutations induce chromatin remodeling and promoter hypermethylation, loss of TET2 is thought to cause an aberrant methylation of promoter regions, IDH1/2 are mutually exclusive in inactivating TET2 mutations, loss of TET2 function leads to demethylation, and TET2 plays a role in myeloid differentiation and regulating stem/progenitor proliferation. One manuscript referred to the methods including the use of TET2 shRNA retroviral vector. Another manuscript made the comparison that they found loss of function mutations in TET2 displayed opposite effects on DNA methylation status; in the reference article, they found that TET2 mutations led to demethylation. In conclusion, this manuscript shows that IDH1/2 mutations were mutally exclusive with TET2 mutations and IDH mutations impaired TET2 activity and hematopoetic differentiation and stem/progenitor proliferation.
