Most cancers are associated with neomorphic enzyme activity and 2-hydroxy glutarate (2-HG) production. Here Figueroa et al., 2010 hypothesize that increased 2HG levels induced by mutant IDH isoforms interferes with DNA methylation and demethylation by inhibiting α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme, TET2 contributing to tumor transformation. The authors conducted a mutational and epigenetic profiling of a large acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient group to test this hypothesis. They found that IDH1/2 mutations are frequent and mutually exclusive in AML with hypermethylation as the dominant feature. A specific aberrant DNA hypermethylation signature was found in IDH1/2 mutants. The expression of 2HG producing enzymes induced a global increase in 5-methylcytosine.  One important finding of this report is that the mutations in IDH1/2 are mutually exclusive with TET2 mutations. Further tests revealed that inhibition of 5-methylcytosine by IDH mutation occurs via TET2. The finding that IDH1/2 and TET2 mutations are mutually exclusive in AML and IDH1/2  mutations induce hypermethylation and inhibit TET2 mediated 5-hydroxymethylation led the authors to test that both mutations might be functioning by alteration in cytosine methylation. They found that TET2 loss-of-function mutant AMLs showed an overlapping hypermethylation signature with IDH1/2 mutant AMLs. The biological significance of IDH1/2 mutations lies in the fact that the expression of IDH1/2 mutants and loss of TET2 showed elevated expression levels of stem cell markers. The results showed that expression of IDH1/2 mutants or loss of TET2 expression increases the proportion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and inhibits normal myeloid differentiation indicating IDH1/2 as a potential leukemia regulator.
