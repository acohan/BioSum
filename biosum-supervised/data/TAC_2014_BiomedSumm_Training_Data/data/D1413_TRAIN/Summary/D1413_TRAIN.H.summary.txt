In manuscript by Figureroa et al., authors have investigated that leukemic neomorphic mutation of the citrate metabolism genes IDH1 and IDH2 that generate the aberrant metabolite 2HG induce DNA methylation and impair differentiation in hematopoietic cells. These effects are caused via inhibition of TET2, a DNA methylase enzyme, which is mutated in leukemia. Primary AML cells mutated for IDH1/2 and TET2 showed a similar defect in epigenetic programming consisting of global hypermethylation and a gene specific methylation signature. To perform this study, 398 samples were used from patients with AML younger than 60 years, for the high-throughput re-sequencing of ID1 and IDH2 which revealed that mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 did not differ. Moreover, expression of IDH2 mutants along with loss of TET2 increase expression of stem cell markers and also impairs myeloid differentiation. A heatmap was used for the validation of the mutant IDH1/2 mutnat methylation signature in a cohort of 344 AMLs. The results from the reference paper were cited as follows: IDH1 mutations induce chromatin modeling and promoter hypermethylation, loss of TET2 is believed to cause an aberrant methylation of promoter region in AML, RNAi mediated TET2 knock down in vitro led to impaired hematopoietic differentiation and regulating stem/progenitor proliferation.  One manuscript cited this reference paper for using the TET2 shRNA retroviral vector. The final conlusion is that IDH1/2 and TET2 mutations were mutually exclusive in AMl cohort. Furthermore, IDH1/2 mutations, which led to elevated levels of 2HG, might be anticipated to inhibit the function of TET2.
