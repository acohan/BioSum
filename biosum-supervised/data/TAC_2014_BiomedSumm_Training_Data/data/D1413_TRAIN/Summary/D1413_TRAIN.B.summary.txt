	Figueroa et al., 2010 reports the genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional profiling of patient derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples.  Specifically, the authors examined the effects of mutations in the IDH1/2 genes as they had been previously associated with AML however the mechanism through which they contribute to malignancy was unknown. The authors found frequent mutations in IDH1/2 in AML samples including the R132 mutation in IDH1 and R172 in IDH2. Analysis of DNA methylation revealed hypermethylation associated with IDH1/2 mutation and epigenetic silencing of the methylated genes when compared with normal bone marrow cells. TET2 is an enzyme involved in demethylation that is frequently mutated in AML. The authors showed  promoter hypermethylation found in TET2 mutation is similar to the pattern found with IDH1/2 mutation. Additionally, TET2 and IDH1/2 mutation were mutually exclusive with AML samples containing one or the other but rarely if ever mutations in both genes. The authors present evidence that 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) production by IDH1/2 correlates with DNA hypermethylation potentially through the inhibition of the hydroxylation reaction of 5-methylcytosine by TET2. These results suggest a mechanism by which TET2 or IDH1/2 mutation leads to global changes in DNA methylation in a mutually exclusive manner. The authors demonstrate that knockdown of TET2 or IDH1/2 mutant expression results in reduced expression of mature myeloid differentiation markers and increases the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Overall the study demonstrates a potential mechanism by which IDH1/2 and TET2 can lead to AML by altering global DNA methylation and hematopoietic differentiation.
