Thirty of these genes could be assessed for gene expression (i.e., they were present on the expression arrays used in this study) and 23/30 (77%) were repressed, consistent with the expected effect of hypermethylation. Although many of these genes were also expressed at relatively low abundance in a subset of IDH1/2-wild-type AMLs, they are uniquely epigenetically silenced through DNA methylation in IDH1/2-mutant AMLs ... The fact that IDH1/2 and TET2 mutations are mutually exclusive in AML and that IDH1/2 mutations induce hypermethylation and inhibit TET2-mediated 5-hydroxymethylation suggested that both mutations may function by altering the cytosine methylation profiles of hematopoietic cells ... Although we have previously shown that aberrant DNA methylation patterning is a characteristic feature of AML (Figueroa et al., 2010), here we demonstrate that IDH1/2-mutant AML is associated with more extensive promoter hypermethylation compared to other AML subtypes. In addition to the global increase in promoter methylation, IDH1/2-mutant AMLs display a robust and unique epigenetic signature, consisting almost entirely of hypermethylated genes, indicating that aberrant cytosine methylation in IDH1/2-mutant AML affects specific loci with known and putative roles in leukemogenesis | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants ... Although IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 mutations were each identified in a significant proportion of patients in our study, there was a statistically significant inverse correlation between IDH1/2 and TET2 mutations in AML (p = 0.009, left-tailed Fisher's exact test). Specifically, we did not identify a single patient with concurrent mutations in TET2 and in IDH1 or IDH2; 0/57 IDH1/2-mutant cases were TET2-mutant versus 28/300 IDH1/2-wild-type AML cases ( Figure 4).

The reaction depends on αKG, iron, and oxygen. Although the physiological significance of 5-OH-MeC remains to be determined, it is likely to be the intermediate in the pathway that actively demethylates 5-methylcytosine ( Wu and Zhang, 2010).

The most prevalent such mutations identified to date affect the genes for cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and its mitochondrial homolog IDH2. IDH1 and IDH2 lesions occur in ∼70% of patients with lower-grade (grade II-III) brain tumors such as astrocytomas, as well as in secondary glioblastomas derived from lower-grade glial tumors ( Hartmann et al., 2009, Parsons et al., 2008, van den Bent et al., 2010 and Yan et al., 2009) ... In previous studies in glioma, it was suggested that IDH-mutant brain tumors were characterized by a methylator phenotype which favors the acquisition of IDH1/2 mutations ( Noushmehr et al., 2010). Alternatively, IDH1/2 mutations could be early events in the process of hematopoietic transformation and precede the stochastic acquisition and accumulation of epigenetic changes that eventually culminate in overt AML. However, our data suggest a more direct mechanistic link between IDH1/2 mutations and dysregulated epigenetic programming in leukemia cells. Specifically, our data suggest that DNA hypermethylation is a consequence of mutant IDH protein expression and that IDH1/2-mutant-mediated epigenetic effects contribute to AML pathogenesis.

Consistent with previous findings (Ito et al., 2010 and Tahiliani et al., 2009), cells expressing TET2 showed higher levels of 5-OH-MeC in the nucleus as detected by immunofluorescence staining with 5-OH-MeC-specific antibody. Cotransfection of TET2 with IDH1 R132H, but not wild-type IDH1, reversed this increase in 5-OH-MeC (Figure 5A). To obtain a more quantitative assessment, we also performed flow cytometric analysis of 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Staining with an anti-FLAG antibody allowed us to discriminate between TET2-positive and TET2-negative populations; importantly, the TET2-positive population showed an ∼4-fold increase in the 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Cotransfection with R132H mutant IDH1 led to an ∼40% decrease in the fluorescence intensity, whereas wild-type IDH1 had no significant impact on 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity (Figure 5B). Consistent with its proposed role in DNA demethylation, TET2 transfection also caused a decrease in 5-methylcytosine, which could be reversed by coexpression of IDH1 R132H mutant but not wild-type IDH1 (Figure S5).
