Specifically, we did not identify a single patient with concurrent mutations in TET2 and in IDH1 or IDH2; 0/57 IDH1/2-mutant cases were TET2-mutant versus 28/300 IDH1/2-wild-type AML cases ( Figure 4).

This analysis allowed us to determine that TET2-mutant AMLs displayed a unique methylation signature consisting of 57 DMRs (p < 0.05 T+BH). IDH1/2-mutant AMLs also displayed a 57-DMR signature when compared to IDH1/2-wild-type and TET2-wild-type AMLs (>2 log2 methylation difference and p < 0.05 T+BH) ... Similar to the case of IDH1/2, there was a marked overall trend toward promoter hypermethylation in TET2-mutant AMLs compared to TET2- and IDH1/2-wild-type AMLs and to NBM CD34+ cells ( Figures 6C and 6D) ... We also examined whether loss of TET2 in cells resulted in a similar increase in 5-methylcytosine levels as did expression of mutant IDH1/2. Two independent short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were used to stably knock down TET2 in murine primary bone marrow cells. LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis revealed that expression of validated TET2 shRNA constructs or IDH1/2 mutations in murine primary bone marrow cells led to an ∼20% increase in 5-methylcytosine levels (Figure S4C). These data suggest that loss-of-function mutations in TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations contribute to leukemogenesis through a shared mechanism that disrupts DNA demethylation | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

To test this hypothesis, we expressed FLAG-tagged TET2 in 293T cells. Consistent with previous findings (Ito et al., 2010 and Tahiliani et al., 2009), cells expressing TET2 showed higher levels of 5-OH-MeC in the nucleus as detected by immunofluorescence staining with 5-OH-MeC-specific antibody. Cotransfection of TET2 with IDH1 R132H, but not wild-type IDH1, reversed this increase in 5-OH-MeC (Figure 5A). To obtain a more quantitative assessment, we also performed flow cytometric analysis of 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Staining with an anti-FLAG antibody allowed us to discriminate between TET2-positive and TET2-negative populations; importantly, the TET2-positive population showed an ∼4-fold increase in the 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Cotransfection with R132H mutant IDH1 led to an ∼40% decrease in the fluorescence intensity, whereas wild-type IDH1 had no significant impact on 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity (Figure 5B).

Similar to the case of IDH1/2, there was a marked overall trend toward promoter hypermethylation in TET2-mutant AMLs compared to TET2- and IDH1/2-wild-type AMLs and to NBM CD34+ cells ( Figures 6C and 6D) ... TET2 loss of function would be anticipated to result in hypermethylation, and the data reported here support this scenario | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |
