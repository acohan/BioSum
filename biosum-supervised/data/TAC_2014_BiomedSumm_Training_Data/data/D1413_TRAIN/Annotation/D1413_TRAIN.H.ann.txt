Cotransfection of TET2 with IDH1 R132H, but not wild-type IDH1, reversed this increase in 5-OH-MeC (Figure 5A).

Staining with an anti-FLAG antibody allowed us to discriminate between TET2-positive and TET2-negative populations; importantly, the TET2-positive population showed an ∼4-fold increase in the 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity.
