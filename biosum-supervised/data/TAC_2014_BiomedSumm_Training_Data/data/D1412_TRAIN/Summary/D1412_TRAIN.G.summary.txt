The manuscript by Cho et al. 2009 describes the role of RIP1 and RIP3 in necrosis. RIP1 and RIP3 were found by using a siRNA library screen to identify kinase genes that are required for necrosis in FADD-deficient Jurkat cells that rapidly undergo programmed necrosis. The authors found that RIP1 and RIP3 become phosphorylated and form a complex to induce necrosis, which is also requires caspase inhibition. In a cell model, caspase was inhibited by zVAD-fmk to investigate cellular roles of RIP1 and RIP3. The major conclusion of this manuscript is that RIP1 and RIP3 modulate necrosis and cell death. The following results and implications were cited: necrosis is a part of human defense against viral infection, following caspase ablation, necrotic cell death is dependent on RIP1 and RIP3 activity, RIP3 acts upstream to regulate RIP1 phosphorylation, caspases are inhibited under physiological conditions such as viral infection, assembly of RIP1/3 complex requires intact RIP1 and RIP3 kinase activity, RIP homolog motifs of RIP 1 and RIP3 are crucial for induction of necrosis, RIP3 binds the RIP hemolytic interaction motif, RIP 1 and RIP3 are involved in TNF-mediated necrosis, necrotic cell death was augmented when caspase activity was compromised with viral inhibitor, level of RIP3 expression is crucial for determining whether the apoptotic or necrotic pathway will proceed, and both RIP 1 and RIP3 become phosphorylated to induce necrosis. In conclusion, this manuscript describes the involvement of RIP1 and RIP3 kinases in necrosis wherein necrosis requires RIP1 and RIP3 complex formation.
