Cho et al 2009 identify RIP3 as a crucial upstream activating kinase that regulates RIP1-dependent programmed necrosis induced by TNF and during virus infection. RIP1 has been previously identified as essential for programmed necrosis, which is a form of caspase-independent cell death differing from apoptosis by its proinflammatory effects. RIP1 also mediates activation of the pro-survival transcription factor NF-κB.RIP3 was identified as an essential component of necrosis using a RNA interference screen. If caspase-8 activity is inhibited, RIP1 and RIP3 are phosphorylated and the necroptosis pathway is switched on. This paper identifies RIP3 as regulating the necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. Both RIP3 and RIP1 are recruited to complex II forming a pronecrotic complex. Both RIP3 and the kinase activity of RIP1 are essential for the stable formation of the RIP1-RIP3 complex, controlling downstream reactive oxygen species production and inflammation. This is a crucial first step in the induction of TNF-mediated programmed necrosis.RIP1 and RIP3 interact with each other via the RIP homotypic interaction motifs, (RHIM) which are unique segments of homologous sequences in both RIP1 and RIP3.The pronecrotic RIP1-RIP3 complex was specifically induced in murine liver by inducing vaccinia virus (VV) infection. RIP3−/− mice failed to the expected initiate virus-induced tissue necrosis, inflammation, and control of viral replication. This indicated the importance of RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis for innate immune control of viral infections. The proinflammatory effects of necrosis are important for successful antiviral immune responses.
