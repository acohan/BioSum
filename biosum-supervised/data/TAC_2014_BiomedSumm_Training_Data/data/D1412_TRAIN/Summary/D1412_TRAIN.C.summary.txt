Necroptosis or programmed necrosis is kind of cell death on which molecular studies are not conducted in plenty. TNF- lke cytokines are known to induce necroptosis and previous studies have shown the involvement of serine/threonine kinase receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) in programmed necrosis. Here Cho et al., 2009 conducted a RNA interference screen to indentify kinases which play crucial role in the same. The authors report RIP3 as a crucial activator of necroptosis which is induced by TNF and during viral infections. Also, RIP1 is shown as a necessary kinase for TNF induced programmed necrosis. They identify RIP3 as a mediator of necroptosis and also report that kinase activity as well as the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) domains is important. When RIP1 and RIP3 complexes were studied, the authors found that RIP3 controls RIP1 binding to complex II and the kinase activity of both are required for regulating their phosphorylation. Requirement of RIP3 for downstream events in necrotic pathway and enhancing the release of ROS is reported. Also, the authors show here that RIP- dependent programmed necrosis is an important cell death pathway induced during viral infections and RIP3 is required for protection against these infections in vivo. However, the authors does not rule out the possibility of involvement of yet some undiscovered kinases. Since necroptosis is a kind of host immune response to fight viral infections, knowledge of RIP3 dependent programmed necrosis and discovery of related kinases may help in better understanding of such infections or diseases.
