	Cho et al., 2009 reports the discovery of RIP3's role in programmed necrosis, an alternative form of cell death that differs from apoptosis in that it is caspase independent. RIP1 was shown to be necessary for TNF induced necrosis. To identify additional members of the necrosis pathway the authors perform a targeted siRNA screen to discover candidates that may regulate necrosis.  They identify another member of the RIP family kinases, RIP3.  RIP3's kinase activity was found to be important for programmed cell death. Additionally, deleting the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) from either RIP1 or RIP3 prevented necrosis. Next the authors looked at the assembly of RIP1 and RIP3 complexes during necrosis. They found the kinase activities of RIP1 and RIP3 are important for regulating the phosphorylation of each protein however it is hypothesized this phosphorylation is facilitated by as yet undiscovered kinases. Kinase defective mutants of RIP1 prevents the formation of the stable RIP1-RIP3 pronecrotic complex. The authors show RIP3 is needed for downstream events in the necrotic pathway including enhancing the release of ROS during programmed necrosis. The article demonstrates an important biological function for programmed necrosis. Viral infections induce the formation of RIP1-RIP3 pronecrotic complexes and lead to inflammation and programmed necrosis. In the absence of RIP3 there is no induction of inflammation or necrosis and there is a failure to illicit an immune response. This allows increased viral replication and ultimately lethality. This bypass of programmed necrosis may represent a viral strategy for immune system evasion.
