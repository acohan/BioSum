In addition, programmed necrosis may control the viral factory by eliminating the infected host cells. An anti-viral role for programmed necrosis is further bolstered by our previous findings that certain viral FLIPs (FLICE-like inhibitor proteins) are potent inhibitors of TNF-induced programmed necrosis (Chan et al., 2003). These results suggest that viral inhibition of programmed necrosis is an important immune evasion strategy for certain viruses ... Taken together, these results show that RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis is an important cell death mechanism when the cellular apoptosis machinery was inhibited by viral inhibitors ... Collectively, our results strongly support a role for RIP3 in promoting programmed necrosis and virus-induced inflammation (Fig. S9) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

We show that RIP3 acts upstream to phosphorylate RIP1, which in turn mediates downstream RIP3 phosphorylation ... Thus, both the kinase and RHIM domains of RIP1 and RIP3 are important for programmed necrosis ... Although RIP3 was not identified as a necrosis mediator in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen (Hitomi et al., 2008), we show that formation of a unique pro-necrotic Complex II composed of RIP1 and RIP3 is a crucial first step in the induction of programmed necrosis | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

Strikingly, the pronecrotic RIP1-RIP3 complex was specifically induced in the liver upon vaccinia virus (VV) infection. RIP3−/− mice failed to initiate virus-induced tissue necrosis and inflammation, resulting in highly elevated viral replication and mortality. These results show that RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis is important for virus-induced inflammation and innate immune control of viral infections ... To test this hypothesis, we examined cell death responses in activated wild type and RIP3−/− T-cells infected with vaccinia virus (VV), which encodes the viral caspase inhibitor B13R/Spi2. VV-infected cells were resistant to death receptor-induced apoptosis but become sensitized to TNF-induced necrosis (Li and Beg, 2000) ...
