An anti-viral role for programmed necrosis is further bolstered by our previous findings that certain viral FLIPs (FLICE-like inhibitor proteins) are potent inhibitors of TNF-induced programmed necrosis (Chan et al., 2003). These results suggest that viral inhibition of programmed necrosis is an important immune evasion strategy for certain viruses ... Strikingly, the pronecrotic RIP1-RIP3 complex was specifically induced in the liver upon vaccinia virus (VV) infection. RIP3−/− mice failed to initiate virus-induced tissue necrosis and inflammation, resulting in highly elevated viral replication and mortality. These results show that RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis is important for virus-induced inflammation and innate immune control of viral infections ... Our results also support a role for RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis in promoting the subsequent virus-induced inflammation. An important role for RIP1/RIP3-mediated programmed necrosis in anti-viral responses is further bolstered by our previous discovery of certain viral FLIPs that potently inhibit programmed necrosis (Chan et al., 2003). More recently, the M45 viral cell death inhibitor from murine cytomegalovirus was shown to interact with RIP1 and RIP3 via the RHIM (Upton et al., 2008). These results suggest that like apoptosis, inhibition of programmed necrosis might be an emerging viral immune evasion strategy | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

VV-infected cells were resistant to death receptor-induced apoptosis but become sensitized to TNF-induced necrosis (Li and Beg, 2000) ... The sensitization to programmed necrosis by VV infection was also observed in MEFs. While TNF alone did not cause cell death in MEFs (Fig. S6), VV-infected MEFs were highly sensitive to TNF-induced necrosis in a RIP3-dependent manner (Fig. 6D). Electron microscopy confirmed that VV-infected underwent necrotic-like cell death in response to TNF (Fig. 6E, panel c). Importantly, while RIP1-RIP3 complex was only detected when cells were stimulated with T/C/Z (Fig. 4E-G) or TNF/zVAD (Fig. 6F, lanes 3-4), TNF alone was sufficient to trigger RIP1-RIP3 association in VV-infected MEFs (Fig. 6F, lanes 5-8). This is in stark contrast to uninfected cells, in which TNF did not trigger RIP1 and RIP3 interaction (Fig. 6F, lanes 1-2).

Another siRNA clone, RIP3, conferred protection against TNF-induced programmed necrosis at a level comparable to that by RIP1 siRNA (Fig. S1). The protection against TNF-induced programmed necrosis by RIP1 and RIP3 siRNAs were specific, since other RIP family kinases including RIP2, RIP4 and RIP5 that were represented in the library did not protect against programmed necrosis (data not shown). We validated these results in TNFR-2+ wild type Jurkat cells (clone 4E3) and found that individual RIP3-specific siRNAs efficiently reduced RIP3 protein expression (Fig. 1A) and inhibited TNF/zVAD-fmk-induced programmed necrosis (Fig. 1B), but had little or no effects on apoptosis induced by TNF or FasL (Fig. 1C-D) ... Wild type T-cells infected with recombinant GFP-VV exhibited normal T-cell activation-induced cell death (AICD) induced by anti-CD3 antibody (Fig. 6A, compare the white bars). In contrast, AICD in GFP-VV infected RIP3−/− T-cells was significantly reduced compared with uninfected GFP− cells in the same culture (Fig. 6A, compare the black bars). VV-infected RIP3−/− cells were also protected from TNF-induced cell death (Fig. 6B, black bars). In fact, TNF stimulated the proliferation of GFP+ VV-infected RIP3−/− cells, which accounted for the negative cell loss.
