The manuscript by Blasco et al. 2011 describes the investigation of the Raf/Mek/Erk signaling pathway in a mouse model of K-Ras driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The major findings of the study were the following: elimination of individual Erk kinases does not prevent K-Ras induced NSCLC, elimination of Erk1 and Erk 2 kinases impairs tumor development and apoptosis, Mek 1 and Mek2 kinases are essential for tumor development, C-raf is essential for K-Ras induced NSCLC, but not b-raf, and mice with systemic depletion of c-raf and b-raf do not die. The authors concluded that ablation of Erk 1 or Erk2 in K-Ras induced NSCLC had no effect due to compensatory mechanisms; elimination of both Erk 1 and Erk 2 blacked tumor growth. The authors also state that c-raf mediates K-Ras signaling and may be a suitable target for therapeutic intervention.  The implications and results of this manuscript were cited mainly that c-raf and not b-raf is essential for K-Ras induced NSCLC, ablation of both Erk 1 and Erk 2 impairs tumor growth, and ablation of MEK1 induces apoptosis and lethality in K-ras induced NSCLC mice.  One manuscript cited the reference article and stated “in vivo ablation of mek in map2k-/- mice…”; however, the reference article did not use map2k-/- mice and instead used mek2-/- mice. In conclusion, this manuscript found that the Raf/Mek/Erk signaling pathway plays a key role in K-ras induced NSCLC and targeting c-raf may be a useful therapeutic target alone or in combination with mek inhibition.
