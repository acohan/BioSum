It is known that the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade of kinases is the major player  for  regulating mitogenic activities.  Accordingly, in this manuscript, authors have identified the role of individual members of the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade in the onset of K-Ras oncogene-driven non-small celllung carcinoma (NSCLC). Ablation of individual Erk kinases does not prevent K-Ras induced NSCLC due to compensatory activities. However, elimination of Erk1/2 kinases impairs tumor development and also induces lethality in adult mice. Furthermore, Mek1/2 kinases are essential for tumor development, while individual Mek1/2 kinases are dispensable for K-Ras driven NSCLC.  The immediate RAs downstream effectors within the Raf/Mek/Erk kinases cascade are A-Raf, B-Raf, and c-Raf. Among them B-Raf was completely dispensable for the K-Ras oncogenic signaling in NSCLS.  However, c-Raf is the major downstream of K-Ras as elimination of c-Raf from K-Ras expressing lung cells completely inhibited tumor development.  These results have been cited by the array of manuscript like as:  c-Raf is indispensable for K-Ras induced NSCLC, c-raf is the main Raf isoform responsible for driving Erk signaling in some Ras mutant tumor, c-Raf knockdown may enhance the anti-tumor effects of Mek inhibition by inhibiting other targets of Raf in addition to Mek, elimination of c-Raf (but not B-Raf)in mice inhibit development and delays the progression of Ras-driven tumors in a adenocarcinoma model, treatment method of tamoxifen was used by the other manuscript.  Results obtained from the present study will be significantly helpful toward the development of effective targeted therapies for the treatment of K-Ras oncogene driven NSCLC.
