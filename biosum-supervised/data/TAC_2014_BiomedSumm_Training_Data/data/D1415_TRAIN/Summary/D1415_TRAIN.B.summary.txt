	Blasco et al., 2011 reports on the role of C-Raf in the K-Ras oncogene transformation of non-small cell lung carcinoma. K-Ras mutation is a known contributor to tumorigenesis however the downstream effectors of Ras responsible for non-small cell lung carcinoma development are unknown. The authors use a mouse model of lung cancer and mutate known downstream Ras effectors to examine their contribution to cancer development as well as normal organ health and homeostasis. Using this strategy they demonstrate the requirement of Erk1/2 and Mek1/2 for tumor development. Additionally, removal of these genes caused severe toxic effects and lethality in adult mice. Interestingly loss or mutation of either Erk kinase or Mek kinase alone was unable to prevent tumor development demonstrating that these kinases are individually dispensable for K-Ras induced transformation. Next the authors showed c-Raf is required for transformation with family members b-Raf and c-Raf unable to substitute for loss of c-Raf. Additionally c-Raf is not required for the health of adult mice and lack the toxic effects associated with loss of Erk1/2 and Mek1/2. The mechanism of c-Raf loss in tumor suppression is unclear, however it does not seem to induce senescence or apoptosis. This suggests c-Raf may act by mediated K-Ras signaling to Mek/Erk kinases or possibly another alternative pathway that is essential for transformation but dispensable for normal cell function. Overall the study demonstrates a model for the identification of potential drug targets through the targeted disruption of K-Ras downstream effectors and monitoring the effect on tumorigenesis.
