Blasco et al 2011 investigate the role of individual members of the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade in the onset of K-Ras oncogene-driven non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). K-RAS oncogenes have been implicated in one-fourth of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) and is one of the human tumors with the worst prognosis. It is known that K-RAS signals through a cascade of kinases which include the RAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 kinases making them potential therapeutic targets. Genetically engineered mouse models were used to systematically examine tumor development. K-Ras+/G12V mice were crossed to strains carrying mutations within loci encoding the Raf, Mek, and Erk kinases. The mice were exposed by intratracheal instillation to replication-defective adenoviruses encoding the Cre recombinase.The ablation of both Erk1 and Erk2 kinases in K-Ras oncogene-expressing lung cells completely prevents tumor development, however their elimination results in apoptosis and lethality in adult mice. Ablation of either Erk1 or Erk2 results in a limited increase of the lifespan of the mice. Similar results were obtained with Mek kinases indicating that the Mek kinases are also essential for adult homeostasis. The ablation of B-Raf was shown to have no significant effect on tumor development. However, c-Raf expression was shown to be essential for tumor development. These results indicate that c-Raf plays a unique role in mediating K-Ras signaling and is a suitable target for therapeutic intervention in K-RAS-driven NSCLC.
