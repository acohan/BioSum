Recently, these models have been utilized to evaluate potential therapeutic targets. Some of the validated targets include well-known downstream elements of KRAS signaling such as components of the mitogenic RAF/MEK/ERK cascade and the PI3K/AKT survival pathway, most of which are druggable kinases (Gupta et al., 2007, Engelman et al., 2008 and Blasco et al., 2011) (Figure 1A) | Reference Offset:  ['2837-3175', '41320-41421', '43824-43938'] | Reference Text:  To date, multiple Ras downstream effectors have been identified. It is generally accepted that the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade of kinases is the primary mediator of mitogenic activity (Marshall, 1994). Another well-known pathway, the PI3Kinase/Pdk/Akt pathway, is thought to mediate survival signals (Cully et al., 2006 and Engelman et al., 2006) ... K-RAS oncogenes signal through a cascade of downstream effectors, most of which are druggable kinases ... The immediate Ras downstream effectors within the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway are the Raf kinases, A-Raf, B-Raf, and c-Raf | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

Thus, neither B-Raf nor A-Raf could compensate for the lack of c-Raf. Because K-Ras is the Ras isoform that binds and activates c-Raf more efficiently ( Voice et al., 1999), it is possible that c-Raf might be essential to mediate K-Ras signaling to the Mek and Erk kinases, at least in an oncogenic setting. Indeed, oncogenic RAS exclusively signaled via c-RAF to the ERK-MAPK pathway in human melanoma cell lines ( Dumaz et al., 2006). However, it is also possible that c-Raf, but not B-Raf or A-Raf, may modulate an alternative downstream pathway essential for malignant transformation ( Takezawa et al., 2009), but not for normal homeostasis.

Control K-Ras+/G12V;Erk1+/+;Erk2+/+ animals (n = 14) displayed a 50% survival at 48 weeks. Instead, the 50% survival point for K-Ras+/G12V;Erk1−/−;Erk2lox/lox mice (n = 11) was reached at 63 weeks ( Figure 2A), thus representing a 40% increase in survival. When we examined K-Ras+/G12V;Erk1−/−;Erk2lox/lox mice 6 months after turning on K-RasG12V expression, we observed very few tumors compared to control animals ( Figures 2B and 2C). More importantly, all tumors tested (n = 6) displayed a prominent band corresponding to the nonrecombined Erk2lox allele and expressed normal levels of Erk2, indicating that these tumors were “escapers” ( Figure 2D). These observations indicate that Erk2 is required for tumor development in the absence of Erk1 | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

To examine whether they also played unique roles during K-RasG12V-driven NSCLC, we crossed K-Ras+/G12V mice with B-Raflox/lox ( Chen et al., 2006) and c-Raflox/lox ( Jesenberger et al., 2001) animals and submitted them to infection with Ad-Cre particles. As illustrated in Figure 5A, conditional ablation of B-Raflox alleles in K-RasG12V-induced NSCLC did not increase survival (50% survival of K-Ras+/G12V;B-Raflox/lox mice [n = 25] at 41.5 versus 40 weeks in K-Ras+/G12V;B-Raf+/+ control animals [n = 28], a 5% increase). The number and grade of tumors in mice lacking B-Raf 6 months after Ad-Cre treatment were similar to those present in control mice ( Figures 5B and 5C). Efficient recombination of the B-Raflox alleles in tumor tissue was determined by Southern ( Figure S5) and western ( Figure 5D) blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry staining with an anti-B-Raf antibody further confirmed the absence of B-Raf expression in tumor tissue ( Figure 5E). Interestingly, elimination of B-Raf expression had no effect on the levels of Mek and Erk phosphorylation, as determined by either western blot ( Figure 5D) or immunohistochemical ( Figure 5E) analysis. These observations suggest that in the absence of B-Raf, other Raf proteins can maintain mitogenic signaling through the Mek/Erk pathway. This compensatory effect did not involve increased expression of the other Raf kinases ( Figure 5D) ... Next, we investigated whether c-Raf kinase was also dispensable for K-RasG12V-driven NSCLCs. Ad-Cre treated K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice survived significantly longer than the control cohort. Whereas 50% of K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raf+/+ animals (n = 22) had to be sacrificed by 38 weeks of age, half of K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice (n = 23) were alive at 63 weeks. This difference represents an 83% increase in survival ( Figure 6A). As expected, this increased survival was a direct consequence of the reduced number of tumors present in K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice 6 months after Ad-Cre treatment ( Figures 6B and 6C). More importantly, each tumor tested (n = 11) retained c-Raflox alleles ( Figure 6D). These results were confirmed by western blot analysis of nine independent tumors ( Figure 6D). These observations indicate that NSCLCs driven by K-RasG12V cannot develop in the absence of c-Raf and that the tumors responsible for the death of the K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice must be “escapers,” as previously observed in mice lacking Erk1/2 and Mek1/2 kinases ... B-Raf was completely dispensable for K-Ras oncogenic signaling, at least within the context of NSCLC. Moreover, phosphorylation of Erk proteins within the tumor appeared to be unaffected, suggesting that other Raf kinases mediate K-Ras oncogenic signaling in the absence of B-Raf | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

These mice (n = 6) also displayed a rapid deterioration of their health, leading to death just 2 weeks after starting the tamoxifen diet ( Figure 4E). Southern blot analysis of DNA isolated from tissues of sick/moribund animals revealed recombination rates of Mek1lox alleles ranging from 70% to 80% in most tissues ( Figure S4A). These observations indicate that the Mek kinases are also essential for adult homeostasis. Whether a single Mek allele might be sufficient to sustain adult life remains to be determined. Necropsy analysis of moribund mice reveled multiple defects, including severe alterations in the structure of intestinal and colonic tissue incompatible with life (Figure S4B). Even limited ablation of Mek alleles resulted in significant alterations of the normal architecture, including distorted crypts, blunted and shorter villi, increased lamina propria, and goblet cell hyperplasia. Likewise, the colonic tissue of Mek1lox/lox;Mek2−/−;RERTert/ert mice displayed loss as well as severe shortening of the crypts ( Figure S4B) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |
