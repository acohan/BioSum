Abstract
The gene that encodes the α-isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3Ca) is frequently mutated in human cancers. We profiled the mutation status of the PIK3Ca gene in the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-60 panel of human cancer cell lines maintained by the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the NCI. Mutation hotspots on the gene were PCR amplified and sequenced, and the trace data were analyzed with software designed to detect mutations. Seven of the cell lines tested have PIK3Ca mutations: two lines derived from breast cancer, two from colon cancer, two from ovarian cancer, and one from lung cancer. BRAF and EGFR genes were normal in the PIK3Ca mutant lines. Two of the cell lines with mutant PIK3Ca also have a mutant version of the KRAS gene. The mutation status was correlated with array-based gene expression that is publicly available for the NCI-60 cell lines. We found increased expression levels for estrogen receptor (ER) and ERBB2 in PIK3Ca mutant lines. The PIK3Ca mutation status was also correlated with compound screening data for the cell lines. PIK3Ca-mutant cell lines were relatively more sensitive than PIK3Ca-normal cell lines to the ER inhibitor tamoxifen and the AKT inhibitor triciribine, among other compounds. The results provide insights into the role of mutant PIK3Ca in oncogenic signaling and allow preliminary identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in cancers harboring PIK3Ca mutations.

The evolution of cancer tissue from normal tissue involves a number of genetic changes that favor the growth of the cancer at the expense of the host. The hallmarks of cancer biology—including unregulated cell growth, the ability to invade surrounding tissue, the ability to metastasize to distant parts of the body, and the loss of the programmed cell death response—are the results of changes that have occurred in genetic make-up of the tumor cells [1] and [2]. Activating somatic mutations are of particular interest because they are potentially causative, rather than “bystander,” changes. The gene encoding the p110 α-catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PIK3Ca, is mutated in a variety of cancer types, including ductal breast cancer (∼40%), colon adenocarcinoma (∼30%), and hepatocellular carcinomas (36%) [3], [4], [5] and [6]. Mutation of PIK3Ca causes constitutive activation of its enzymatic activity [7]. Once activated, PI3K phosphorylates phosphoinositol lipids on the D3 position of the inositol ring generating PtdIns-3-phosphates (PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3). These lipids recruit pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins such as the serine–threonine kinase Akt and PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) to the plasma membrane. After recruitment to the membrane, Akt is phosphorylated by PDK, leading to AKT activation. Activation of AKT plays a pivotal role in fundamental cellular functions such as cell proliferation and survival by phosphorylating a variety of substrates [8] and [9].

Two mutation hotspots on the PIK3Ca gene at amino acids 545 (glutamic acid) and 1047 (histidine) account for the majority of mutations found in tumor tissue [3]. The proteins encoded by the mutant versions of the PIK3Ca gene have increased enzymatic activity [7] and induce oncogenic transformation of chicken embryo fibroblast cells [10]. A recent study by Saal et al. [11] demonstrated that human breast cancer tissue samples with PIK3Ca mutations have higher levels of ERBB2 and nuclear hormone gene expression than tissue with normal alleles.

We determined the mutation status of PIK3Ca in the NCI-60 panel of human cancer cell lines. These cell lines are widely used for cell-based signaling studies and in vivo tumor models. They are derived from a variety of cancer tissue types: lung, colon, ovary, melanoma, central nervous system, leukemia, prostate, and breast [12], [13], [14], [15] and [16]. There is a wealth of publicly available data about the cell lines, including responses in cellular proliferation assays to small molecule anti-cancer compounds [17]; gene expression profiles based on several array-based technologies [18] and [19]; and the mutation status of genes encoding KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS [20]. Using the statistical algorithm COMPARE [6], [17] and [21], developed at the National Cancer Institute, we correlated the PIK3Ca mutation status of the cells with array-based gene expression data. Genes that had consistent changes in expression on at least two arrays are noted. Interestingly, estrogen receptor and ERBB2 genes had increased expression in PIK3Ca mutant cells. We also correlated PIK3Ca mutation status with cellular growth inhibition data. Several drug-like compounds from the NCI Standard Panel were identified that had statistically better efficacy in PIK3Ca mutant cell lines compared to lines with normal PIK3Ca alleles.

Methods
Mutation analysis. Genomic DNA from the NCI-60 cell lines was isolated using Magna Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit 1 and the MagnaPure LC Instrument (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The regions to be sequenced in the PIK3Ca, BRAF, and EGFR genes were amplified in nested PCRs, followed by bi-directional sequencing on an ABI 3730 DNA analyzer. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for PCR are available online in the supplementary materials Table S3. Primers were used at a concentration of 1 pM, and the reaction conditions for both the boost and nested reactions were as follows: 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 25 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; 40 cycles; 72 °C for 7 min. The internal nested oligo was used as the sequencing primer. The PCR oligos for exon 9 of PIK3Ca were designed to differentiate the PIK3Ca genetic sequence on chromosome 3q26.32 from the similar sequence for another gene on chromosome 22q11 [11]. Trace data were analyzed using the Mutation Surveyor software package (Soft Genetics, State College, PA).

Gene expression. Gene expression profiles for the NCI-60 cell lines have been obtained on several microarray platforms, including cDNA [19] and [22] and oligonucleotide-based chips [18] and [23]. These data are publicly available in a readily searchable format at the website for the Developmental Therapeutics Program at the National Institutes of Health 1 [18] and [24]. Genes whose mRNA levels correlated with the mutation status of the PIK3Ca gene were identified utilizing the JMP software package (SAS Institute). Given the uncertainty in an individual measurement from a single microarray, we first identified a subset of genes whose measurement on multiple microarray platforms was well correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient > = 0.5). This was done using the microarray datasets available through the DTP web site and included four arrays: a cDNA array [19] and [22], an Affymetrix HUM6000 array (from Millenium Pharmaceuticals, unpublished data), an Affymetrix U95A array (Novartis, unpublished data), and an Affymetrix U95A–E array (Gene Logic, unpublished data). Utilizing this subset of 5796 genes (∼20,000 total measurements), we performed correlation analyses with the mutation status of PIK3Ca. The results were further filtered to include only those genes where measurements on multiple microarrays gave significant correlations with mutation status.

Drug sensitivity. The COMPARE algorithm was used to identify compounds that had greater or lower efficacy in growth inhibition assays in cells with PIK3Ca mutations. The cell lines with PIK3Ca mutations were entered into the web-based interface, and the program generated a list of compounds sorted by Pearson correlation coefficient. The top 10 compounds are listed in Table 3.

Results and discussion
The molecular analysis of tumor tissue can yield a wealth of information about the oncogenic pathways that are active in a given patient’s tumor. For example, gene expression profiles have been used to classify cancers into clinical subtypes [25] and [26] and to predict clinical outcome [27] and [28]. Testing breast cancer tissue for HER2 amplification successfully identifies those patients most likely to respond to the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody treatment Herceptin [29]. The finding that BRAF is mutationally activated in several human cancers [30] has stimulated widespread drug discovery efforts targeting this serine–threonine kinase. Several recent studies have shown that lung-cancer patients who respond well to anti-EGFR small molecule inhibitors harbor somatic mutations in the kinase domain of the EGFR gene [31], [32], [33], [34] and [35]. Finally, the PIK3Ca gene has been shown to be mutationally activated in several human cancers [3], [36] and [37], changing the perception of this inositol kinase from being seen as a potential target to being generally accepted as validated [20] and [38].

In this work, we used cancer cell lines in the NCI panel rather than tissue derived from clinical samples. The cell lines have several advantages over cancer tissue. They are clonal and immortal, and thus can be used repeatedly in controlled experiments. In contrast, tissue derived from a cancer patient is heterogeneous and may have been exposed to one or more types of therapeutic agents in varying dosages. The cell lines are widely available, unlike tumor tissue, which is often difficult to obtain. They can be genetically manipulated by in vitro techniques, such as transfection and viral infection. They represent a broad spectrum of primary tissues, and several of the lines have been used for in vivo tumor models in mice and rats. Most importantly, the cell lines have been extensively characterized by the National Cancer Institute and by numerous laboratories around the world, leading to a wealth of publicly available data. Publicly available information about the cells includes global gene expression profiles and response in proliferation assays to anti-cancer compounds. Our work extends the knowledge base for these cell lines by identifying those lines that harbor PIK3Ca mutations ( Table 1).

The sequence variants detected are described according to the cDNA sequence with GenBank Accession No. NM_006218.2. Nucleotide position refers to position within coding sequence, where position 1 corresponds to the first position of the start codon. Mutations in RAS family genes are from [20] and [32]. Mutations in PIK3Ca were determined as described in Methods. The complete list of NCI-60 cells, with mutation status, is available online, Table S1. Electropherograms of the mutated sites is available online as Fig. S1.

Table options
We found eight mutations in seven cell lines (see Table 1 and Fig. 1). Four of the mutations were in exon 9: three at position 545 (545E>K/E) and one at position 549 (549D>N/D). Position 545 is a mutation hotspot in the helical domain region and accounts for the ≈20% of the PIK3Ca mutations documented by COSMIC (the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, Sanger Institute) in clinically derived samples [32]. All of the mutations were heterozygous, as expected for an activating mutation in an oncogenic gene [3]. The gene encoding PIK3Ca in the colon cancer cell line HCT-15 has two codon nine mutations, 545E>K/E and 549D>N/D. The mutation at position 549 is novel [32]. Since the 545 mutation is typically sufficient in itself to activate the PIK3Ca enzyme, the 549 mutation may be a bystander alteration. Since our method involves sequencing from a pool of PCR products, we are not able to determine if the double mutations in HCT-15 reside on the same allele (i.e., one double mutant and one wild type allele) or two different alleles (i.e., mixed heterozygotes).

There were also four mutations in exon 20: three at position 1047 (1047H>HR or R) and one at the termination codon (1069X>X/W in the IGROV cell line). Mutation of position 1047 from H to R is the single most common mutation in the PIK3Ca gene in cancer tissue, representing approximately one-third of the total (109 of 322) mutation count in COSMIC [32]. The 1069X>X/W mutation in IGROV causes a loss of the normal stop codon, resulting in a four amino acid C-terminal addition: WKDN. This mutation appears to be novel, as it is not listed among 322 PIK3Ca mutations documented by COSMIC (the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, Sanger Institute) [32]. The effect of this C-terminal extension on PIK3Ca enzymatic activity is currently unknown. The cell line UO-31, derived from renal carcinoma, had a silent polymorphism at nucleotide 3075 (C>CT), both alleles coding for a threonine at position 1025. This rare alteration has been previously reported in an advanced ovarian carcinoma sample [37].

The mutation frequency in the cell lines varies with the tissue of origin: two of seven (29%) for breast cancer lines; two of seven (29%) for colon cancer lines; two of six (33%) for ovarian lines; one of nine (11%) for lung cancer lines. No PIK3Ca mutations were found in the cell lines derived from melanoma (eight), prostate (two), CNS (six), leukemia (six) or renal cancer (eight). Given the small sample size represented by the NCI-60 panel, the mutation frequency in the cell lines agrees reasonably well with the observed frequency of PIK3Ca mutations in human cancer tissue: ∼40% for breast cancer, ∼30% for colon cancer, ∼7% for ovarian cancer, and ∼2% for lung cancer [4], [32] and [39]. We also sequenced mutation hotspots on the genes encoding BRAF (exons 11 and 15) and EGFR (exons 18, 19, and 21) in the PIK3Ca-mutant cells ( Table 1). None of the cell lines with PIK3Ca mutations had a mutation in the genes encoding BRAF or EGFR, suggesting that activation of BRAF or EGFR does not bestow a selective advantage to cells that have mutated PIK3Ca gene. Two colon lines, HCT-15 and HCT-116, and one lung cancer line, NCI-H460, contained PIK3Ca and KRAS2 mutations. The mutation status of KRAS2 was determined for the NCI-60 cell lines by Dr. George Vande Woude, Van Andel Research Institute, 2 and by the Sanger Institute. 3 Velho et al. [40] noted that in colorectal carcinoma tissue, PIK3CA mutations occur preferentially together with activating KRAS mutations.

The cell lines comprising the NCI-60 cell panel are widely used in proliferation, migration, and survival assays [41]. PIK3Ca signaling plays an important role in each of these phenotypes [8] and [9]. Knowledge of the mutation status of the PIK3Ca gene ( Table 1) will help in the design and interpretation of in vitro experiments with these cell lines. For example, RNAi reagents can be designed to down-regulate specific PIK3Ca alleles to study their effects on cell signaling, survival, etc. [42]. In addition to in vitro studies, several of the cell lines identified with PIK3Ca mutations are used widely in in vivo tumor models. The mutation status of PIK3Ca would be expected to strongly influence the apparent efficacy of compounds that target receptor tyrosine kinases [43], AKT [44], as well as other enzymes [8] that signal through PIK3Ca.

Mutational activation of PIK3Ca leads to activation of Akt ( Fig. 1), and AKT in turn phosphorylates multiple proteins, including transcription factors in the forkhead, AP-1, and NF-κB families [36] and [45]. Thus through direct effects on transcription factors and indirect effects through various other pathways, activation of PIK3Ca can alter the gene expression. Global gene expression profiles of the NCI-60 cells have been obtained on a variety of microarray platforms [18] and [19], and these data are publicly available [18]. In order to determine how PIK3Ca mutation may alter gene expression in members of the NCI-60 panel of cell lines, the COMPARE algorithm [6], [17], [21] and [46] was used to identify genes whose expression level correlated with the mutation status of the PIK3Ca genes. To be included, the levels of expression had to change in a similar fashion on at least two arrays, with P values of less than 0.01. The HUGO-approved [47] names and descriptions of the top 10 genes, ranked by Pearson correlation coefficient, are listed in Table 2. The complete list of genes with altered expression levels in PIK3Ca mutant cell lines is available online in the supplementary materials (Table S2). Two genes of particular interest that significantly increased in expression levels were ERBB2 (HER2), a receptor tyrosine kinase, and ESR1, a transcription factor activated by estrogen binding. Saal et al. [11] recently published results of a study of 342 breast cancer tissues showing that PIK3CA mutations were associated with increased expression of ESR1 and HER2. The fact that these genes were identified independently using two different approaches suggests that there is a robust association between their level of expression and the mutation status of the PIK3Ca gene.

The observation that cells with PIK3Ca mutations express HER2 and ESR1 has potential therapeutic implications because the gene products for ESR1 and HER2 are targets for well-established cancer therapeutics: tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with anti-estrogenic activity [48], and Herceptin, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, is an effective treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer. Our results suggest that screening for PIK3Ca mutations in cancer patients may help select a patient population that is more likely to respond to these treatments.

While the proteins encoded by HER2 and ESR1 genes have been linked to PIK3Ca mutation status [11], the other genes whose level of expression correlates with the mutation status of PIK3Ca in the NCI-60 cells ( Table 2) have not been identified as part of PIK3Ca signaling pathways. These genes encode products with diverse cellular functions, including the transport of aminophospholipids between leaflets of membranes (ATP8A1), binding of RNA (MSI, CIRBP), and regulation of transcription (MSX2). It will be of interest to see if the expression of these genes correlates with PIK3Ca mutation status in human cancer tissue. If any of these gene products contributes to the transformed phenotype in PIK3Ca-mutant cells, they could be candidate drug targets.

The PIK3Ca mutation status was correlated with each cell line’s sensitivity to growth inhibition by small molecule anti-cancer compounds [21]. The compounds in this list are derived from the NCIs “Standard Agent Database” [17]. Most of the compounds in the database are “drug-like,” having been submitted for testing in New Drug Applications or Investigational New Drug Applications. Table 3 shows the names and NSC numbers (the NCIs internal identification number) of the top 10 compounds that correlated with PIK3Ca mutation status, along with their putative mechanism of action, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and the two-tailed P value. The compounds represent drug classes with diverse mechanisms of action, including topoisomerase inhibitors (chloroquinoxaline sulfonate, ICRF-187, and MX2 HCL), alkylating agents (streptozoticin), and anti-metabolites (AT-125, diglycoaldehyde, dichloroally lawsone, and 3-deazauridine). It is not clear for many of these compounds whether the activity demonstrated against PIK3Ca mutated cells is mechanism based, i.e., related to PIK3Ca activity, or to other features of the cell lines. It will be of interest to determine in future experiments how well PIK3Ca mutations in human cancer cells predict sensitivity to these drugs.

For two of the compounds, tamoxifen and triciribine, the gene expression results and our knowledge of the signaling pathway provide a context for interpreting the finding that these compounds preferentially inhibit the growth of cells harboring PIK3Ca mutations. Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen used in adjuvant therapy following primary treatment for early stage breast cancer. As mentioned above, there was a strong correlation between the presence of a PIK3Ca mutation and expression of estrogen receptor, the target of tamoxifen. One interpretation of these data is that PIK3Ca activation leads to increased expression of the estrogen receptor gene and increased production of estrogen receptor protein, which then confers a growth advantage to the mutant cells. This growth advantage would be blocked by tamoxifen, causing the reduced cellular proliferation. This hypothesis can be readily checked using the cell lines.

Triciribine is an anti-cancer agent that has been evaluated in a number of clinical trials, beginning in the 1980s [49] and [50]. Its mechanism of action has been ascribed to its ability to inhibit nucleic acid synthesis [51], but it has recently been shown to have potent and specific inhibitory activity toward the serine–threonine kinase AKT [52]. The finding that triciribine specifically inhibits the growth of cells carrying PIK3Ca mutations can be understood based on the role of AKT in mediating PIK3Ca signaling. As depicted in Fig. 2, AKT is activated immediately downstream of PIK3Ca [9]. Mutational activation of PIK3Ca causes constitutive activation of AKT [7], and many of the effects of mutational activation of PIK3Ca are channeled through AKT [36]. Inhibition of AKT by triciribine would be expected to block some of the oncogenic potential of mutationally activated PIK3Ca. Specific inhibition by triciribine of in vitro growth of cell lines harboring PIK3Ca mutations may be due to a positive role of aberrant PIK3Ca signaling in driving cellular proliferation in these cells. This hypothesis can be readily tested using the NCI-60 cell lines. For example, specific downregulation of the mutant PIK3Ca allele with RNAi [53] could be used to explore the role of the mutation in driving in vitro proliferation.

A central assumption of the work described in this paper is that the gene expression and drug sensitivity data that are available for the NCI-60 cell lines can be correlated with mutation status of a key regulatory gene, PIK3Ca. This approach is clearly exploratory and has notable limitations, since it can be argued that the correlations we identified—such as the increased expression of ERBB2, or the increased sensitivity to triciribine in PIK3Ca mutant cell lines—may be statistical flukes rather than reflections of a real underlying connection. However, there are numerous publications that demonstrate the value of this approach. Examples include correlating P53 status in NCI-60 cell lines with drug sensitivity [54], in predicting chemosensitivity based on transcript profiling [23], and in developing hypotheses about the mechanisms of action of novel chemotherapeutic compounds [18]. While the work described in this paper is exploratory, the hypotheses it generates are readily testable and have significant therapeutic implications. Perhap, the most significant of these is that cancer cells with PIK3Ca mutations may be particularly sensitive to the compounds listed in Table 3. Many of these compounds have been in the clinic already and thus have established pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles. For tamoxifen and triciribine, there is a rationale for why their activity correlates with PIK3Ca activity. For the other compounds, such as the topoisomerase inhibitor chloroquinoxaline sulfonate, there is no clear link with the PIK3Ca pathway. It will be of interest to see if other human cell lines with PIK3Ca mutations are indeed particularly sensitive to this compound, or the others listed in Table 3, in in vitro growth inhibition studies and in vivo tumor models. Validation of the correlations between PIK3Ca mutation status and drug sensitivity in cell-based and animal models would serve as preamble to exploratory tests of these compounds in a clinical setting. It is now very practicable to screen tumor tissue for specific mutations in key regulatory genes, such as PIK3Ca. The next step is to be able to use this information to provide the patient with better, tailored, therapeutic options.
