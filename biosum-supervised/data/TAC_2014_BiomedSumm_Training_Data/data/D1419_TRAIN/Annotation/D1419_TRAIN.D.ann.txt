Moreover, specific expression profiles in the diagnostic samples of either T-ALL or hyperdiploid ALL appear to be accurate predictors of relapse ... Although a distinct expression profile was defined that identified those TEL-AML1 ALL patients who developed secondary AML, it remains to be determined if the profile represents genes that are mechanistically involved in the enhanced risk or are only statistical associations | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

Representative examples include the gene pair selection method [10] and correlation-based methods the rationale behind which is that a good feature subset is highly correlated with the class and uncorrelated with each other [11], [12] | Reference Offset:  ['10373-10788', '43908-44689'] | Reference Text:  We next used statistical methods to identify those genes that best define the individual groups. The expression profiles obtained using the top 40 genes per subgroup selected by a chi-square metric are illustrated in Figure 1B, using the two-dimensional hierarchical clustering algorithm. The chi-square metric is a statistical test of association and provides a rank-ordered list of genes for each genetic subgroup ... Unsupervised hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant analysis with variance (DAV), and self-organizing maps (SOM) were performed using GeneMaths software (v.1.5, Applied Maths, Belgium). Data reduction to define the genes most useful in class distinction was performed using a variety of metrics as detailed in the Supplemental Data at http://www.stjuderesearch.org/data/ALL1. Genes selected by the various metrics were used in supervised learning algorithms to build classifiers that could identify the specific genetic or prognostic subgroups. Algorithms used included k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), prediction by collective likelihood of emerging patterns (PCL), an artifical neural network (ANN), and weighted voting | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |
