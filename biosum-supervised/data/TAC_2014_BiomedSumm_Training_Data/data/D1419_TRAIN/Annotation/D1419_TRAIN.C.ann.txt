The same clustering method was also used to group the leukemia samples on the basis of similarities in their pattern of genes expressed (see Supplemental Data at http://www.stjuderesearch.org/data/ALL1) ... Classification was performed using the supervised learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), with a set of discriminating genes selected by a correlation-based feature selection (CFS) or, if this method selected >20 genes for a particular class, using the top 20 ranked genes selected by a chi-square metric or one of the other metrics detailed in the Supplemental Data ... Data reduction to define the genes most useful in class distinction was performed using a variety of metrics as detailed in the Supplemental Data at http://www.stjuderesearch.org/data/ALL1 | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  C, |
