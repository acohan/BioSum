Through a reiterative process of error minimization, these supervised learning algorithms learn to recognize the optimal gene expression patterns for a specific subtype. Classification was approached using a decision tree format, in which the first decision was T-ALL versus B lineage (non-T-ALL) and then within the B lineage subset, cases were sequentially classified into the known risk groups characterized by the presence of E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, BCR-ABL, MLL chimeric genes, and lastly hyperdiploid with >50 chromosomes. Cases not assigned to one of these classes were left unassigned (see Supplemental Data, Figure S19 at http://www.stjuderesearch.org/data/ALL1) | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  H, |

To further assess the predictive power of the different gene expression profiles, we again used supervised learning algorithms.

Thus, our data supports the interpretation that these leukemic subtypes are distinct biological and clinical entities.
