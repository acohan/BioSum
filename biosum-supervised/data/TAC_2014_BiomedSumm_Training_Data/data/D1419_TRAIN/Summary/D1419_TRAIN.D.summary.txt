Yeoh et al 2002, identify the prognostically and therapeutically relevant subgroups of childhood ALL using gene expression profiling, Microarray expression analysis plus a variety of computer-assisted supervised learning algorithms identified the distinct expression profiles for each of the prognostically important leukemia subtypes, including T-ALL, E2A-PBX1, BCR-ABL, TEL-AML1, MLL rearrangement, and hyperdiploid >50 chromosomes. The accuracy for predicting the subtype with their methodology was found to be >95%. Despite having relatively homogenous morphology and limited variability in the T or B cell differentiation, each leukemia subtype is found to have a distinct expression profile that involves a large number of genes.Their results demonstrate a correlation between gene profile and the risk of relapse, with T-ALL or hyperdiploid ALL showing an much greater risk of relapse after treatment.  Also, their approach could enhance the ability to identify patients who are at a high risk of developing marrow relapse and drug-related toxicities. The findings can be used not just to predict outcome but assess a patient’s risk of failing therapy. In addition, the identified expression profiles were found to include new diagnostic and subclassification markers, which can be used as candidates to develop therapeutic agents. The database generated by this study of comprehensive gene expression profiles coupled with detailed immunophenotype, cytogenetic, molecular diagnostic, and treatment outcome data should be an invaluable resource for studies of pediatric leukemia and aid to defining individualize therapy so that each patient has the highest chance for cure.
