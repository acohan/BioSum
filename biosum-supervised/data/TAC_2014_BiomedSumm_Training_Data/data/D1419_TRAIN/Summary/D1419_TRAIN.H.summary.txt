The manuscript by Yeoh et al., describes the gene expression profile as a tool for identifying the subclass of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in pediatric patients.  Authors analyze the expression of 12,600 genes in diagnostic leukemia blast from 360 pediatric ALL patients using oligonucleotide microarray. These studies demonstrate that expression profiling is not only useful for accurate identification of known lineage and molecular subtype of ALL, but also provides new insights into their underlying biology.  Apart from that, gene expression profiling allows the accurate identification of some patients who are at a high risk for falling conventional therapeutic approaches. From a technical point of view, gene expression profiling should be considered alternative to standard diagnostic approach for the diagnosis. Several manuscripts cited this manuscript for the gene profiling of pediatric ALL patients e.g. one manuscript cited this for theoretical analysis and simulation methods used for real gene expression data to analyze 7 datasets, MLL cells have expression of HOXa7, HOXa9 and Meis1, high classification accuracy of 90-95% for gene expression signature in children diagnosed with ALL. Gene expression pattern identified by Yeoh et al. has been used by other scientific groups to identify prognostic subsets with morphologically similar tumor. One group analyzed transcriptome using microarray, used by the Yeoh et al., to profile the global changes in human cancers. The data presented in the manuscript suggest that the single platform of gene expression profiling provides a robust and accurate approach for the diagnosis and risk stratification of pediatric ALL patients.
