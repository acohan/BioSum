The manuscript by Yeoh et al. 2002 describes gene expression profiling as a tool for identifying the subclass of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in pediatric patients. The authors analyzed 327 diagnostic bone marrow samples with oligonucleotide microarrays with 12,600 probe sets. A large portion of the samples (72.8%) were separated into subgroups: T-ALL, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, and hyperdiploid subtypes of ALL. The gene expression array could also be used to discriminate between subgroups of BCR-ABL, MLL, and the novel subgroup of ALL. A single gene was sufficient to provide 100% accuracy for both T-ALL and E2A-PBX1 cases. Using the top 20 genes from expression profiling, the relapse accuracy was 97% and 100% for T-ALL and hyperdiploid subgroups. This demonstrates that gene expression profiling can be used to identify patients that are high risk for relapse/drug treatment failure. The following results and implications were cited: gene expression profiling can be used to determine disease subtype, can identify gene expression differences between tumors even though the histological characteristics are similar, can profile global gene changes using gene expression in human cancers, 90-95% accuracy in classifying ALL subtypes using gene expression, erythropoietin receptor is 7.4 fold higher expressed in TEL-AML1 positive cases compared to B-ALL cases, MLL cells have persistent expression of HOXa7 and HOXa9, and gene expression profiling can be used to classify cancers to predict treatment outcome. One study used the same dataset for empirical analysis of 7 genome expression databases to identify factors that influence statistical power of complex data sets.
