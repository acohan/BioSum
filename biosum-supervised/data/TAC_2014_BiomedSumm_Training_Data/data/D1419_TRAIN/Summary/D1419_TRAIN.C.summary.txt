Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease consisting of different leukemia subtypes due to which these subtypes show marked difference in their response to chemotherapy. To determine if gene expression profiling of leukemic blasts can enhance prognostic criteria, Yeoh et al., 2002 used oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze the expression of 12,600 probe sets in diagnostic leukemia blasts from 327 pediatric ALL patients. Using clustering method the authors identified six major leukemia subtypes that correspond to T-ALL, hyperdiploid with >50 chromosomes, BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, and MLL gene rearrangement. They also identified a subgroup of 14 cases that had a distinct gene expression profile. Similar results were obtained when the hierarchical clustering was done with genes selected by statistical metrics. The accuracy of microarray results was confirmed by real time RT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis showing that microarray analysis provides accurate expression levels of most genes. These identified genes could be used as new diagnostic and sub-classification markers which can provide insight into the tumor biology of different ALL leukemia subtypes. Using computer assisted learning algorithms; the authors show that this classification model had an overall accuracy of 96%. The rare cases misclassified by gene expression profile reflected an abnormality of the TEL transcription factor which may help in identifying a specific leukemia subtype. Tumors having homogeneous morphology and limited variability showed distinct expression involving a large number of genes. Altogether, this study demonstrates gene expression profiling as a potential approach for diagnosis and risk stratification of pediatric ALL patients.
