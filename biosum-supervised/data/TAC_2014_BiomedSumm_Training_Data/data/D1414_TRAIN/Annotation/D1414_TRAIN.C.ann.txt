Surprisingly, however, Bcl-2 overexpression did not prevent ABT-737-induced death (Figure 5C), even though its level was sufficient to inhibit Etoposide-induced apoptosis (Figure 5D). Thus, if Mcl-1 is inactivated, Bcl-2 overexpression does not diminish the cytotoxic activity of ABT-737, and Bcl-xL overexpression does so only moderately. This suggests that combining ABT-737 with strategies to inactivate Mcl-1 has therapeutic potential, even in the many tumors where Bcl-2 is markedly elevated | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Six of the seven BH3 mimetic compounds tested at doses previously reported to be efficacious caused nonspecific toxicity, as they killed cells independently of Bax/Bak (Figure 1). Although these compounds bind Bcl-2-like proteins with low affinities, their predominant cytotoxic activity thus seems to be mediated through pathway(s) other than those regulated by Bcl-2. This nonspecific activity presumably would limit their therapeutic efficacy and potentially provoke undesirable side effects | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Downregulation of Mcl-1 by several strategies conferred sensitivity to ABT-737. Furthermore, enforced Mcl-1 expression in a mouse lymphoma model conferred resistance ... Indeed, we find that Mcl-1 greatly constrains the cytotoxic action of ABT-737. Accordingly, we show that several strategies for downregulating Mcl-1, some clinically applicable, render diverse cells highly sensitive to ABT-737, even in the face of high Bcl-2 expression ... Why is Mcl-1 downregulation so important for killing by ABT-737 or Bad? First, the rapid degradation of Mcl-1 following certain cytotoxic stimuli (Cuconati et al., 2003, Nijhawan et al., 2003 and Willis et al., 2005) (Figure 7 and Figure 8) may help to ensure irreversible commitment to apoptosis. Second, since Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are the only prosurvival proteins that guard Bak (Willis et al., 2005), Mcl-1 is the only barrier to Bak-mediated apoptosis when ABT-737 engages Bcl-xL | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

The well tolerated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Seliciclib (R-roscovitine/CYC202), currently in phase II clinical trials for non-small-cell lung cancer and breast tumors, is now thought to function by impairing RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase II, with mcl-1 mRNA being a key target because of its rapid turnover ( MacCallum et al., 2005 and Raje et al., 2005).

Significantly, the expression of mcl-1 and a1 mRNA is very low in most malignancies of those types (see the Gene Expression Omnibus repository at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=geo). On the other hand, in those tumors where Mcl-1 is the predominant survival protein, such as multiple myeloma ( Zhang et al., 2002), ABT-737 is unlikely to be effective as a single agent. Thus, the expression levels of prosurvival proteins, particularly Mcl-1 and A1, in individual tumors should be valuable prognostic markers for responses to ABT-737 | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

In contrast to these compounds, in solution competition assays (Chen et al., 2005) the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 (Oltersdorf et al., 2005) bound with high affinity to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w (IC50 < 10 nM), but not detectably to the more divergent Mcl-1 or A1 (Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online).

A striking but consistent finding was that ABT-737 sensitized cells overexpressing Bcl-2 to a much greater extent than those overexpressing Bcl-xL (Figure 5, Figure 7 and Figure 8; Figure S4), even though the affinity of ABT-737 for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL is comparable (Figure S1A and Oltersdorf et al., 2005) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Hence, antagonists of certain growth factors may well sensitize tumor cells to ABT-737. For example, antagonists of IL-6 or VEGF signaling may sensitize multiple myeloma, CLL, and perhaps other tumor types (e.g., Huang et al., 2000, Jourdan et al., 2003 and Le Gouill et al., 2004) to ABT-737 | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |
