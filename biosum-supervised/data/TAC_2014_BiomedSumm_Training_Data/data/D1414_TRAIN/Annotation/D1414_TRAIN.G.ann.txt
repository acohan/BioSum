A striking but consistent finding was that ABT-737 sensitized cells overexpressing Bcl-2 to a much greater extent than those overexpressing Bcl-xL (Figure 5, Figure 7 and Figure 8; Figure S4), even though the affinity of ABT-737 for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL is comparable (Figure S1A and Oltersdorf et al., 2005) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  G, |

This approach could be particularly effective in overcoming the chemoresistance imparted by overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (Figure 7) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  G, |

Indeed, we found that both Seliciclib and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) reduced Mcl-1 levels ( Figure 8C) and markedly boosted the action of ABT-737 in HeLa carcinoma cells ( Figure 8D) and modestly augmented it in MEFs (data not shown) | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  G, |

We therefore conclude that ABT-737 causes Bax/Bak activation indirectly, by binding tightly and selectively to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w ( Figure 2 and Figure S1) | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  G, |

Furthermore, direct binding studies using isothermal calorimetry confirmed tight stoichiometric (1:1) binding of ABT-737 to Bcl-xL (Figure S1B), akin to the binding of Bim (Figure S1C), whereas unlike Bim (Figure S1D) the drug did not bind Mcl-1 (Figure S1B) | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  G, |

As predicted, ectopic Mcl-1 expression rendered these cells resistant to ABT-737, whereas Bcl-2 overexpression at much higher levels had no effect (Figure S3) ... Our results also predict that tumors initially sensitive to ABT-737 may eventually become resistant by Mcl-1 upregulation. Indeed, the efficacy of ABT-737 to prolong survival of mice transplanted with a lymphoma is severely compromised if Mcl-1 is overexpressed ( Figure 6) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  G, |
