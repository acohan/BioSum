Therefore, there is great interest in the prospect of developing anticancer agents that directly target Bcl-2-like prosurvival proteins by mimicking the BH3 domain (Baell and Huang, 2002, Fesik, 2005 and Rutledge et al., 2002) ...

In conclusion, the present studies validate the feasibility of targeting Bcl-2-like proteins using BH3 mimetics such as ABT-737 to induce apoptosis (Oltersdorf et al., 2005). The mechanistic insights provided here suggest ways in which ABT-737 might be used efficaciously as a single agent and in combination therapy. They also identify Mcl-1 and A1 as likely prognostic markers for clinical responses and suggest that Mcl-1 upregulation or stabilization may well emerge as a mechanism of resistance to the drug | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

Even though Noxa targets both Mcl-1 and A1 (Chen et al., 2005), absence of the latter in many cell types (see below and Willis et al., 2005) points to Mcl-1 as an important predictor of responsiveness to ABT-737 ...
