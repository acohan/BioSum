The potent sensitization observed here (Figure 7; Figure S4) and by others (Oltersdorf et al., 2005) suggests that combination therapy with ABT-737 should render genotoxic agents more effective at lower doses, potentially reducing undesirable collateral damage or ensuring more stable remissions with conventional doses.

Indeed compounds that broadly fall into this class have entered clinical development. ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic, is one example [41]. Recently, it has been reported that ABT-737 is not cytotoxic to all tumors cells, and that “chemoresistance” to ABT-737 is dependent on appreciable levels of Mcl-1 expression, the one Bcl-2 family member it does not effectively inhibit [42], [43]. Indeed, suppression of Mcl-1 protein levels by shRNA knockdown or indirect pharmacological downregulation sensitizes resistant tumor cells to ABT-737 mediated cell death [44], [45] | Reference Offset:  ['878-1253', '5959-6951', '26373-26656'] | Reference Text:  Of seven putative BH3 mimetics tested, only ABT-737 triggered Bax/Bak-mediated apoptosis. Despite its high affinity for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, many cell types proved refractory to ABT-737. We show that this resistance reflects ABT-737's inability to target another prosurvival relative, Mcl-1. Downregulation of Mcl-1 by several strategies conferred sensitivity to ABT-737 ... ABT-737 holds great promise, as it avidly binds the prosurvival proteins most similar to Bcl-2 and induces Bax/Bak-dependent killing. Nevertheless, with many cells, ABT-737 was not cytotoxic on its own. Its behavior mirrored that of the BH3-only protein Bad, which we showed recently to be a relatively weak killer because it cannot engage the more divergent Bcl-2 homolog Mcl-1 (Chen et al., 2005 and Willis et al., 2005). Recent studies argue that Mcl-1 has a critical, distinctive role in the control of apoptosis (Cuconati et al., 2003, Nijhawan et al., 2003 and Opferman et al., 2005). Indeed, we find that Mcl-1 greatly constrains the cytotoxic action of ABT-737. Accordingly, we show that several strategies for downregulating Mcl-1, some clinically applicable, render diverse cells highly sensitive to ABT-737, even in the face of high Bcl-2 expression. These findings have notable implications for the ways potential drugs like ABT-737 might be used for treating patients with cancer ...

Recent reports have revealed that the overexpression of Mcl-1 compensates for the loss of the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2/xL [5,6].

Since tumors often overexpress Bcl-2 (Tsujimoto et al., 1985) or Bcl-xL, we also tested the impact of their overexpression. Even when Mcl-1 was inactivated (by expressing Noxa), Bcl-xL overexpression conferred limited resistance to ABT-737 (Figure 5C), perhaps by raising the level of ABT-737 targets. Surprisingly, however, Bcl-2 overexpression did not prevent ABT-737-induced death (Figure 5C), even though its level was sufficient to inhibit Etoposide-induced apoptosis (Figure 5D). Thus, if Mcl-1 is inactivated, Bcl-2 overexpression does not diminish the cytotoxic activity of ABT-737, and Bcl-xL overexpression does so only moderately. This suggests that combining ABT-737 with strategies to inactivate Mcl-1 has therapeutic potential, even in the many tumors where Bcl-2 is markedly elevated | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  E, |
