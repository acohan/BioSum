Van Delft et al., 2006 establish that the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 targets selective Bcl-2 proteins and efficiently induces apoptosis if Mcl-1 is neutralized. The study tested seven BH3 mimetics finding that only ABT-737 requires the expression of Bax and Bak for its cytotoxic action. ABT-737 avidly binds the prosurvival proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL to Bcl-w to induce apoptosis. However, the one Bcl-2 family member it does not effectively inhibit is Mcl-1. It was found that with many cells, ABT-737 was not cytotoxic on its own and it is concluded that this is due to ABT-737 being unable to engage the more divergent Bcl-2 homolog Mcl-1. It appears that the expression of Mcl-1 greatly constrains the cytotoxic action of ABT-737.Several strategies are shown for downregulating Mcl-1, including the use of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor roscovitine. This treatment renders diverse cells highly sensitive to ABT-737, even in the face of high Bcl-2 expression.Targeting the prosurvival Bcl-2-like proteins for cancer therapy is attractive because their overactivity promotes tumor formation and often limits responses to cytotoxic agents. However, many tumors do not depend on Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Bcl-w proteins, but rather rely on the anti-apoptotic factor MCL1.ABT-737 showed its efficacy as a single agent is restricted to tumors where Mcl-1 is low, as expression of MCL-1 is a key determinant of drug resistance.
