The overactivity of Bcl-2 like proteins is known to promote tumor formation and offer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, development of anticancer agents that directly target Bcl-2 like prosurvival proteins by mimicking the BH3 domain is attractive. ABT-737 is such an agent which binds the Bcl-2 like proteins and induces Bax/ BAk- dependent killing. However many cells types prove refractory to ABT-737. Here, VanDelft et al., 2006 conducted a study to explore the functions of Mcl-1 in inducing resistance in cells against ABT-737. They found that most putative BH3 mimetics do not kill BH3-only like proteins. Solution compound assays showed that ABT-737 targets the same set of proteins as the Bad-like BH3 only protein. Mcl-1 neutralization was found to be necessary to efficiently kill cells by ABT-737 via Bax/Bak. In human carcinoma cells Mcl-1 downregulation inactivates prosurvival proteins thereby inducing apoptosis. The authors show that ABT-737 cause Bax-Bak activation indirectly by binding selectively to Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Bcl-w. When Mcl-1 was inactivated, Bcl-2 overexpression did not prevent ABT-737-induced cell death indicating that therapies combining ABT-737 and Mcl-1 inactivation might prove more effective. In vitro data and results from mouse lymphoma model clearly show that overexpression of Mcl-1 renders sensitive cells resistant. Moreover, the authors implicate that using ABT-737 with cytokine antagonists or inhibitors to reduce Mcl-1 level might suppress Bcl-2 overexpressing tumor cells. Altogether, this paper identifies Mcl-1 and proposes that combined therapy using ABT-737 and Mcl-1 inactivating agents will be effective in treating tumors which overexpress Bcl-2 and/or Mcl-1.
