The manuscript by Van Delft et al. 2006 describes the ability for ABT-737 to bind BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W, which are key regulators of apoptosis in cancers. Unlike other BH3 mimetic proteins, ABT-737 competitively binds BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-W with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. ABT-737 did not bind MCL-1. In mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), Bak/Bax deficient MEFs were resistant to ABT-737 induced cell death. BCL-XL and MCL-1 overexpression were found to confer resistance to ABT-737; however, BCL-2 overexpression did not prevent ABT-737 induced cell death.  Inhibitors of MCL-1 did sensitize cells to ABT-737. This manuscript also proposes that MCL-1 and A1 proteins may be used as prognostic markers for clinical responses and that MCL-1 upregulation is a mechanism of drug resistance. These results that show ABT-737 is capable of inducing apoptosis and ABT-737 may be used to target the BCL-2 regulated pathway for therapeutic manipulation. The results and implications of this manuscript were cited including targeting BCL-2 overexpression as a target for cancer therapy may be effective, MCL-1 expression is a key determinant of resistance to ABT-737, ABT-737 is not cytotoxic to tumor cells, ABT-737 binds BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W, ABT-737 does not bind MCL-1, overexpression of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 is associated with drug resistance, and downregulation of BCL-XL induces apoptosis and increases chemosensitivity to ABT-737. In conclusion, this manuscript shows that ABT-737 is a potential therapeutic that induces apoptosis in cancer cells through the BCL-2 pathway; however, resistance to ABT-737 in MCL-1-dependent tumors is a hurdle.
