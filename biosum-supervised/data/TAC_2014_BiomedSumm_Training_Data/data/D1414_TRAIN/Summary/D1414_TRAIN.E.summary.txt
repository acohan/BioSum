Van Delft et al. investigate potential anticancer agents that target Bcl-2 proteins in the BH3 domain which promote tumor formation and cause the apoptosis process to malfunction. Only ABT-737 was found to bind to Bcl-2, Bcl-x and Bcl-w but not to Mc1l1 or A1.  ABT-737 was found to be similar to BH3 protein Bad in that it induced Bax/Bak dependent apoptosis in a similar mechanism. Mcl-1 was found to prevent the cytotoxic action of ABT-737 and was further investigated for its role in ABT-737 process.  shRNA was used to test sensitivity ABT-737 by inhibition of Mcl-1 in HeLA and MCF-7 breast epithelial cells.  Also, the drug activity and Bak/Bax activation was tested to see effects on cells.  A1 normally not found in most tumor cells reduced sensitivity to ABT-737 similar to Mcl-1. Overexpression of Bcl-2 did not remove the cytotoxic activity of ABT-737 even with Mcl-1 inactivation.  However, overexpression of Mcl-1 causes resistance to cells in vitro and in vivo but sensitizes the cells when Mcl-1 is inactive.  ABT-737 was also combined with genotoxic agents and cytokine support was eliminated to reduce Mcl-1 levels to investigate ABT-737 effects.   In conclusion, ABT-737 was found to be a promising candidate in clinical trials due to its non-toxic in vitro and in vivo effects.  ABT-737 is predicted to be used individually in tumors where Mcl-1 is low or not present.  In Mcl-1 expressing tumors, other avenues such as combined therapy must be investigated since reducing Mcl-1 expression is key in sensitizing cells with ABT-737.
