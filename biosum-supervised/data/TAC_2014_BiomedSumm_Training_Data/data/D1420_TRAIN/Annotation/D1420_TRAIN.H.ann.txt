Consequently, we combined inhibition of the proteasome and Rho/ROCK signaling with the clinical compounds bortezomib and fasudil, respectively.

A detailed description of the original RNAi screen has been submitted for publication elsewhere (M.S., M.M.-A., D.C.H., and J.D., unpublished data) ... The assay measured both cell viability and caspase activity. The top 50 hits from this screen were then tested against a cell line panel consisting of 28 cancer cell lines (14 KRAS mutant and 14 KRAS WT) from colon, lung, pancreas, ovary, and stomach tumors. Nine cell lines overlapped between that panel and the lung-only 26 cancer cell line panel reported here in Figures 1A and S1AñS1D. Using apoptosis induction as a readout, GATA2 knockdown showed the greatest selectivity for the KRAS mutant genotype after KRAS itself | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  H, |

Using cell viability as the biological read-out, they identified the transcription factor GATA2 essential for the proliferation of cell lines carrying oncogenic KRAS | Reference Offset:  ['7190-7618', '7620-7943', '67103-67486'] | Reference Text:  To discover novel genes necessary in KRAS mutant cancer cells, we performed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen targeting some 7,000 human genes in a panel of KRAS mutant and wild-type (WT) cancer cells. Among other factors (including KRAS itself), we found that loss of the transcription factor GATA2 led to a decrease in KRAS mutant cell viability and an increase in apoptosis (M.S., M.M.-A., D.C.H., and J.D., unpublished data) ... To extend these findings, we analyzed 26 NSCLC cell lines, of which 14 were KRAS mutant and 12 were WT. Short-term GATA2 knockdown led to specific decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells, comparable to the effect seen with loss of KRAS itself ( Figure 1A and Figure S1A available online) ... Over 7,000 genes were individually targeted using Dharmacon's ìdruggable genomeî collection of SMARTpool siRNAs, including all G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), protein kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, proteases, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, plus genes involved with apoptosis, senescence, nucleic acid binding, autophagy, DNA repair, and characterized nuclear receptors | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  H, |

Strikingly, we observed numerous Rho-related signaling pathways as being broadly occupied by GATA2 in mutant cells but not in WT cells (Figure S4C). Among these Rho-pathway genes is the Rho kinase ROCK1, as seen in Figure 5A. By ChIP-PCR, we verified that several of the Rho-pathway genes were bound by GATA2 in mutant but not WT NSCLC cells (Figure 5B) ... In total, these results suggest that GATA2 directly regulates expression of Rho-signaling components ... Recognizing this regulation of Rho targets by GATA2, we assessed the functional consequences of GATA2 loss on Rho activity. GATA2 knockdown triggered a striking decline in GTP-bound Rho (including RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC isoforms) in mutant lung cancer cells (Figure 5D) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  H, |

Although the effect of this combination on the stroma might also contribute to inhibition of tumor growth, as seen for ROCK/JAK inhibition in squamous cell cancers ( Sanz-Moreno et al., 2011), our combined genetic and pharmacological analyses suggest a strong cell-autonomous effect of GATA2 pathway suppression on the tumor tissue, as in the KrasLSL-G12D model Gata2 is deleted only in tumor cells and not stroma, endothelial, or other host tissues ...

Eight weeks after infection, we compared the cohort histopathologically and observed a very large reduction in tumor burden in KG F/F animals compared to both KG +/+ and F/+ controls ( Figures 6A and 6B). Moreover, both KG F/+ and KG F/F mice exhibited a significant decrease in tumor number relative to KG +/+ controls, with KG F/F animals exhibiting a more striking decline ( Figure 6C) ... In contrast, the average sizes of the tumors that did arise were comparable among KG +/+, F/+, and F/F mice ( Figure 6D). To characterize the tumors in KG F/F mice, we prepared DNA from these lesions and analyzed recombination. Intriguingly, tumors from KG F/F mice retained an unrecombined floxed Gata2 allele, whereas the Kras allele was completely recombined in the same lesions ( Figure 6E).
