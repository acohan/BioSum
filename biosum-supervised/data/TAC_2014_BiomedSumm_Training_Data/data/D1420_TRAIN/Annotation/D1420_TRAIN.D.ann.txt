In particular, the proteasome, and indirectly NF-ÎºB, can be inhibited with the FDA-licensed drug bortezomib and the Rho/ROCK-signaling cascade with fasudil, which has been approved for clinical use in Japan. To examine combined inhibition of these pathways on KRAS mutant NSCLC, we first treated a subset of KRAS mutant and WT cells with the individual drugs and their combination. Notably, whereas there was a substantial effect of combined bortezomib/fasudil treatment in mutant cells, the effect was much less pronounced in WT cells ( Figure S7B) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

Strikingly, we observed numerous Rho-related signaling pathways as being broadly occupied by GATA2 in mutant cells but not in WT cells (Figure S4C). Among these Rho-pathway genes is the Rho kinase ROCK1, as seen in Figure 5A. By ChIP-PCR, we verified that several of the Rho-pathway genes were bound by GATA2 in mutant but not WT NSCLC cells (Figure 5B) ... Taken together, these effects demonstrate that GATA2 is necessary for Rho-pathway activation in RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

As expected, A549 cells exhibited reduced viability with loss of either KRAS or GATA2, whereas H322M cells were unaffected ( Figure 1B). Surprisingly, PC9 cells were also dependent on GATA2 for viability.

In these animals, lung tumors develop spontaneously from expression of mutant Kras due to spontaneous recombination ( Johnson et al., 2001). We then induce whole-body deletion of Gata2 using the CreERT2 conditional allele expressed from the Rosa26 locus ( Hameyer et al., 2007) ... As seen in Figures 6H and 6I, we found that Gata2 loss had a striking effect, with near-complete abrogation of lung tumors in treated LG F/F mice.
