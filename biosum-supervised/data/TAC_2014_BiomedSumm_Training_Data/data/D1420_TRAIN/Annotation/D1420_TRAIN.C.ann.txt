Among other factors (including KRAS itself), we found that loss of the transcription factor GATA2 led to a decrease in KRAS mutant cell viability and an increase in apoptosis (M.S., M.M.-A., D.C.H., and J.D., unpublished data) ... Taken together, these findings suggest that KRAS mutant NSCLC cells depend upon GATA2 for survival | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

(2012) identified that some genes involved in RHO-related signaling pathways were occupied by GATA2 in KRAS mutant but not wild-type tumor cells. Not surprisingly, GATA2 knockdown in KRAS mutant cells resulted in a striking reduction of active GTP-bound RHO proteins, including the downstream ROCK kinase | Reference Offset:  ['33438-33787', '35807-35950', '36319-36620'] | Reference Text:  By ChIP-PCR, we verified that several of the Rho-pathway genes were bound by GATA2 in mutant but not WT NSCLC cells (Figure 5B). Furthermore, our original GSEA included Rho-related cell adhesion pathways among the GATA2-regulated gene sets (Figure S4D), and qRT-PCR revealed reduced expression of Rho-pathway targets with GATA2 depletion (Figure 5C) ... GATA2 knockdown triggered a striking decline in GTP-bound Rho (including RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC isoforms) in mutant lung cancer cells (Figure 5D) ... This effect on Rho-pathway activation was specific to RAS-pathway mutant lung cancer cells, as phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (pMLC), a substrate of ROCK1 and downstream marker for Rho signaling, was suppressed in mutant cells with GATA2 knockdown but was unaffected in WT cells (Figure 5E) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

As expected, A549 cells exhibited reduced viability with loss of either KRAS or GATA2, whereas H322M cells were unaffected ( Figure 1B). Surprisingly, PC9 cells were also dependent on GATA2 for viability. Examination of additional EGFR mutant (H3255) and KRAS mutant (H441) NSCLC cells revealed similar effects for GATA2 ( Figure S1D) ... To further validate GATA2, we designed shRNAs against GATA2. To this end, one shRNA (shGATA2.1) achieved substantial knockdown of GATA2 in A549 and PC9 cells relative to a control (shGAPDH) and a nonfunctional GATA2 shRNA (shGATA2.2) (Figure 1C). Notably, shGATA2.1-expressing A549 and PC9 cells had greatly reduced viability relative to the other shRNAs but did not affect WT H322M cells (Figure 1D) ... Examination of additional KRAS and EGFR mutant cells showed a striking dependency on GATA2 for mutant cell viability ( Figure S1F).

Here, looking for agents that could specifically kill KRAS mutant cells, they found that knockdown of GATA2 was synthetically lethal with KRAS mutation | Reference Offset:  ['7724-8237', '13549-13949', '16195-16576'] | Reference Text:  Short-term GATA2 knockdown led to specific decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells, comparable to the effect seen with loss of KRAS itself ( Figure 1A and Figure S1A available online). Comparison of expression across the panel revealed no significant differences in GATA2 expression between mutant and WT cells (data not shown). Interestingly, the relative effect of GATA2 loss on viability correlated with the extent of GATA2 knockdown in mutant but not WT cells ( Figure S1B) ... To further validate GATA2, we designed shRNAs against GATA2. To this end, one shRNA (shGATA2.1) achieved substantial knockdown of GATA2 in A549 and PC9 cells relative to a control (shGAPDH) and a nonfunctional GATA2 shRNA (shGATA2.2) (Figure 1C). Notably, shGATA2.1-expressing A549 and PC9 cells had greatly reduced viability relative to the other shRNAs but did not affect WT H322M cells (Figure 1D) ... As seen in Figure 2A, injection of control shRNA-expressing RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC cells led to robust tumor growth. In contrast, GATA2 knockdown cells completely abrogated tumor formation, with no detectable lesions forming over 9 months.

Beyond this initial approach, such treatment strategies could be improved further by inhibition of IL-1 signaling with IL-1 receptor monoclonal antibodies (Dinarello, 2010).
