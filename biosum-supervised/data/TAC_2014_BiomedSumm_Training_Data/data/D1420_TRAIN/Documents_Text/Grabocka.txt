WT-H-Ras suppression leads to regression of K-Ras tumors in response to DNA damage
Summary
Mutations in KRAS are prevalent in human cancers and universally predictive of resistance to anticancer therapeutics. Although it is widely accepted that acquisition of an activating mutation endows RAS genes with functional autonomy, recent studies suggest that the wild-type forms of Ras may contribute to mutant Ras-driven tumorigenesis. Here, we show that downregulation of wild-type H-Ras or N-Ras in mutant K-Ras cancer cells leads to hyperactivation of the Erk/p90RSK and PI3K/Akt pathways and, consequently, the phosphorylation of Chk1 at an inhibitory site, Ser 280. The resulting inhibition of ATR/Chk1 signaling abrogates the activation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint and confers specific sensitization of mutant K-Ras cancer cells to DNA damage chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo.

Significance
This study defines a functional dependence of K-Ras-driven tumors on wild-type H- and N-Ras for the DNA damage response and reveals a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of mutant K-Ras tumors. We demonstrate that mutant K-Ras cancer cells require wild-type H-Ras and N-Ras for the activation of the ATR-Chk1-mediated DNA damage checkpoint and that this dependence can be exploited to specifically sensitize K-Ras-driven cancers to DNA damage-inducing agents.

Introduction
Three closely related RAS oncogenes, HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS, have been identified in mammals. These genes encode small GTPases that function as molecular switches governing the activation of a vast network of signaling pathways. Growth factor signaling activates Ras by recruiting guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that catalyze the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) ( Bos et al., 2007). In turn, Ras activity is terminated through GTP hydrolysis, which is greatly enhanced by GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs). Hyperactivation of Ras, which largely occurs through the acquisition of mutations that hinder GTP hydrolysis, has been implicated in the etiology of a wide number of human cancers. Overall, mutations in the RAS genes have been associated with ∼30% of all human tumors. Such mutations are generally limited to one of the RAS genes, with KRAS being the most frequently mutated and with the highest incidence in adenocarcinomas of the pancreas (57%), colon (33%), and lung (17%) ( Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011).

The critical role of oncogenic K-Ras as a driving mutation in the pathogenesis of cancer is supported by several genetically engineered mouse models. Accordingly, expression of mutant K-Ras alone is sufficient to drive malignant progression, whereas elimination of mutant K-Ras from established tumors leads to tumor regression (Chin et al., 1999, Fisher et al., 2001, Haigis et al., 2008, Jackson et al., 2001, Li et al., 2011 and Ying et al., 2012). Because of its capacity to constitutively engage downstream effector pathways, oncogenic K-Ras was initially thought to drive the tumorigenic process independently of the wild-type forms. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the biological outputs of oncogenic K-Ras are subject to a complex and context-dependent modulation by wild-type Ras proteins. Studies in chemically induced models of lung or skin tumorigenesis have demonstrated that the acquisition of an activating mutation in a KRas or HRas allele is associated with loss of the KRas wild-type or HRas wild-type allele, respectively ( Bremner and Balmain, 1990, Hegi et al., 1994 and Zhang et al., 2001). Zhang et al. (2001) further demonstrated that loss of the wild-type KRas allele enhanced mutant K-Ras-driven tumorigenesis. Together, these results suggest a tumor suppressive effect of the wild-type Ras allele. Conversely, a recent study reported that in mutant K-Ras-driven colorectal cancer, wild-type K-Ras plays a tumor promoting role through counteracting mutant K-Ras-induced apoptosis by mediating signaling from mutant K-Ras-dependent autocrine-activated EGFR ( Matallanas et al., 2011).

Mutant K-Ras-driven cancers also retain the wild-type products of the remaining RAS genes, H- and NRAS, which appear to synergize with mutant K-Ras in tumors of various tissues. For example, enhanced levels of GTP-bound H-Ras and N-Ras, due to mutant K-Ras-dependent nitrosylation of wild-type H- and N-Ras, were shown to be required for the proliferation of mutant K-Ras cancer cells ( Lim et al., 2008). A role for wild-type H-Ras and N-Ras proteins in mediating RTK signaling and proliferation of cancer cells that harbor mutant K-Ras has also been demonstrated ( Young et al., 2012). Moreover, Son of Sevenless (Sos), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ras and Rho GTPases, has been implicated in mutant Ras-driven tumorigenesis ( Jeng et al., 2012).

In the current study, we sought to determine the mechanisms by which wild-type H-Ras and N-Ras proteins promote the mutant K-Ras-driven tumorigenic phenotype.

Results
Mutant K-Ras Cancer Cells Require Wild-Type H-Ras for Proliferation and Progression through Mitosis
To investigate the functional relationship between mutant K-Ras and wild-type (WT) H/N-Ras, we took the approach of specifically suppressing the expression of WT-H-Ras and/or WT-N-Ras, in cancer cells positive or negative for mutant K-Ras. To this end, we initially employed the isogenic colon cancer cells DLD-1 K-RasWT/G12D (DLD1 K-RasMut) and DLD1 K-RasWT/− (DLD1 K-RasKO), where the K-RASG12D allele has been knocked out by homologous recombination ( Luo et al., 2009b and Shirasawa et al., 1993). These cell lines were engineered to harbor doxycycline (Dox)-inducible small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) directed at H-Ras, N-Ras, or both H- and N-Ras. Accordingly, doxycycline treatment specifically suppressed expression and activity of the targeted isoforms, with no effect on the remaining isoforms ( Figures 1A and 1B; Figure S1A available online). As shown in Figure 1C, individual knockdown of WT-H-Ras or WT-N-Ras in DLD1 K-RasMut cells led to slower growth. Of note, no synergy was observed upon knockdown of both WT-H-Ras and WT-N-Ras, suggesting that the two WT-isoforms converge on the same signaling module that regulates growth of DLD1 K-RasMut cells ( Figure 1C). In contrast, knockdown of either WT-H-Ras or WT-N-Ras, or the two combined, in DLD1 K-RasKO cells, had no effect on cell growth, indicating that the dependence on WT-H- and/or N-Ras for cell growth is a specific property of mutant K-Ras cancer cells ( Figures 1D and S1A).

We next investigated whether the attenuated cell growth observed upon WT-H-Ras and/or N-Ras knockdown in DLD1 K-RasMut cells could be the result of a slower progression through the cell cycle. Initially, we examined the cell-cycle progression of WT-H-Ras-suppressed DLD1 K-RasMut cells that were synchronized at the G1/S border by double thymidine treatment. Six hours after release, both WT-H-Ras-suppressed (+Dox) and WT-H-Ras-intact (−Dox) DLD1 K-RasMut cells had completed replication and were predominantly in G2 as determined by the accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1B). However, whereas the majority of WT-H-Ras-intact cells completed mitosis and cell division and reached G1 over the next 4 hr, WT-H-Ras-suppressed cells showed a delayed transition through G2/M, as evident by the persistence of cells with 4N DNA content (Figure 1E, arrows). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of phosphohistone H3-positive cells revealed an increased mitotic index of WT-H-Ras-suppressed cells relative to control (7–11 hr), suggesting that the elevated fraction of 4N DNA content cells associated with WT-H-Ras knockdown was due to a mitotic delay (Figures 1E and 1F). Consistent with this interpretation, WT-H-Ras-suppressed DLD1 K-RasMut cells showed mitotic defects that would preclude the timely satisfaction of the spindle checkpoint, including misaligned and damaged chromosomes (Figure 1G). To quantitatively measure the mitotic delay within individual cells and rule out the possibility that the observed mitotic aberrations were due to the synchronization technique, we analyzed the duration of mitosis in asynchronous cells by time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy. We observed that WT-H-Ras knockdown delayed mitotic progression in DLD1 K-RasMut cells (duration of mitosis was ∼2 times longer compared to control), but not in DLD1 K-RasKO cells (Figures 1H, S1C, and S1D). Similar results were obtained when this analysis was extended to the pancreatic cell line pair Panc-1 (K-Ras mutant) and BxPC-3 (K-Ras WT) (Figure 1H; Movies S1 and S2; Figures S1C and S1D). Taken together, these data indicate that K-Ras mutant cells specifically require WT-H-Ras for the timely progression of mitosis.

Wild-Type H- and N-Ras Knockdown Enhance DNA Damage in Mutant K-Ras Cancer Cells
In principle, the delay in mitosis and damaged chromosomes, induced by WT-H-Ras knockdown, can be explained by misregulation of the DNA damage response (DDR) (Rieder and Maiato, 2004, Brown and Baltimore, 2000, Lam et al., 2004, Löffler et al., 2006 and Zachos and Gillespie, 2007). A defective DDR would compromise the ability of the cell to repair DNA damage, thereby leading to an enhancement in the levels of DNA strand breaks (Syljuåsen et al., 2005 and Toledo et al., 2011b). Evaluation of DNA strand breaks by monitoring γH2AX staining revealed a significant accumulation of γH2AX-positive cells upon knockdown of WT-H-Ras in the DLD1-K-RasMut cells and a panel of K-Ras mutant (Mut) pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1, AsPC-1, PL45, and MIA PaCa-2) (Figures 2A–2C). In contrast, γH2AX levels remain unaltered when WT-H-Ras was knocked down in the DLD1-K-RasKO and K-Ras WT pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC-3 and Hs-700T), consistent with K-Ras Mut cancer cells being selectively dependent on WT-H-Ras for modulating DNA damage and cell-cycle progression (Figures 2A–2C). A similar dependency was observed upon knockdown of WT-N-Ras, and no synergistic effect was observed when both WT-H-Ras and WT-N-Ras were knocked down (Figures S2A–S2C). The elevated γH2AX levels were not due to an accumulation of cells in S-phase because there was no significant difference in the S-phase profiles between control and WT-H-Ras, WT-N-Ras, or WT-H- and N-Ras-suppressed cells (Figures 2A and S2B). Of note, we have observed no correlation between enhanced γH2AX levels due to WT-H- and/or N-Ras knockdown and the proliferative rate or basal γH2AX levels of the cancer cells analyzed (Figure S1D; data not shown). This suggests that the elevated DNA damage induced by WT-H- and/or N-Ras knockdown is not due to a faster proliferation rate or higher basal DNA damage of K-Ras mutant cells but instead is a consequence of a perturbed DDR. Moreover, knockdown of WT-H-Ras in melanoma cells that harbor an activating N-Ras mutation (NRas Q61L) also enhanced γH2AX levels, indicating that WT-Ras could be required for the regulation of the basal levels of DNA damage in cancer cells with activating mutations in any of the Ras isoforms (Figure S2E).

Dependence of Mutant K-Ras Cancer Cells on Wild-Type H- and N-Ras for the Activation of the G2 DNA Damage Checkpoint
To directly evaluate whether WT-H-Ras knockdown impacted the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, we subjected K-Ras Mut cells to UV-C irradiation and monitored mitotic entry at 1, 2, and 3 hr intervals after UV-C-induced damage. Panc-1 and DLD1-K-RasMut cells expressing scramble shRNA displayed a block in mitotic entry in response to UV-C-induced DNA damage, indicating a functional G2 DNA damage checkpoint (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). In contrast, progression into mitosis following UV-C treatment was unperturbed in Panc-1 and DLD1-K-RasMut cells depleted of WT-H-Ras, indicating a defective G2 DNA damage checkpoint (Figures 3A and 3B). This defect was not specific to UV-C-induced damage as Panc-1 (Figure 3C) and DLD1-K-RasMut cells (Figure S3B) depleted of WT-H-Ras failed to initiate and maintain cell-cycle arrest in response to the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN38. A similar defect was observed in Panc-1 cells depleted of WT-N-Ras (Figure S3C).

A predictable outcome of a defective G2 DNA damage checkpoint is entry into mitosis with unresolved DNA breaks following damage (Jiang et al., 2009). In agreement with this prediction, a significant fraction of WT-H- and/or N-Ras-depleted Panc-1 and DLD1-K-RasMut cancer cells that entered mitosis following UV-C exposure also stained positive for γH2AX (Figures 3D, 3E, and S3D). Notably, no such differences were observed in K-Ras WT cancer cell lines (Figures 3E and S3D). These data demonstrate that WT-H- and/or N-Ras are critical for the establishment of a functional G2 DNA damage checkpoint selectively in K-Ras Mut cancer cells.

Wild-Type H- and N-Ras Knockdown Impairs Chk1 Activation in K-Ras Mutant Cancer Cells
To gain insight into the molecular basis for the perturbation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint by WT-H/N-Ras knockdown, we examined the DNA-damage-specific activation of ATR/Chk1 and ATM/Chk2 in response to SN38 or UV-C treatment (Bartek and Lukas, 2003 and Zhou and Elledge, 2000). Notably, WT-H-Ras knockdown was accompanied by a defective Chk1 activation in response to either SN38 or UV-C treatment in K-Ras Mut cell lines Panc-1 and DLD1-K-RasMut (Figures 3F, S3E, and S3F), and MIA PaCa-2 (Figure S4A) as evidenced by impaired phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser 317 and Ser 345. The requirement for WT H-Ras for ATR/Chk1 activation was a specific property of K-Ras mutant cells as WT-H-Ras knockdown had no effect on Chk1 activation in the K-Ras WT cell lines BxPC-3 and DLD1-K-RasKO (Figures 3F, S3E, and S3F). The defect in Chk1 activation upon WT H-Ras knockdown in K-Ras mutant cells was also reflected in the impaired inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 at Tyr 15 (Figures 3F and S3E). By comparison, Chk2 activation, as monitored by phosphorylation of Chk2 at threonine 68 (Thr68), was not affected by WT-H-Ras knockdown in either K-Ras Mut (Panc-1) or K-Ras WT (BxPC-3) cancer cell lines (Figures 3F and S3E). Of note, Chk2 protein levels in DLD1 cells were too low to reliably measure its activation status. WT-N-Ras knockdown also led to a selective and similar impairment of ATR/Chk1 activation in K-Ras mutant cells (Figure 4). Taken together, these results indicate that the defective G2 DNA damage checkpoint caused by WT-H/N-Ras knockdown in K-Ras mutant cells is due to the failure to properly activate Chk1.

Wild-Type H- and N-Ras Negatively Regulate MAPK and Akt Signaling to Control Chk1 Phosphorylation
The Ras effector signaling pathways, Raf/Erk and PI3K/Akt, have been shown to play a key role in Chk1 activation and the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. PI3K/Akt was reported to override DNA-damage-induced G2 arrest through repression of Chk1 activation via Akt-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser 280 (King et al., 2004, Puc and Parsons, 2005 and Shtivelman et al., 2002). More recently, the Raf/MAPK pathway has been shown to impair Chk1 activity through Chk1 Ser 280 phosphorylation by MAPK-activated protein kinase RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) (Li et al., 2012 and Ray-David et al., 2012). As wild-type Ras proteins have been reported to antagonize Ras effector signaling output in cancer cells that harbor mutant Ras (Young et al., 2012), we next investigated whether impaired Chk1 activation upon WT-H- or N-Ras knockdown was due to enhanced activation of Ras effector pathways. Knockdown of WT-H- or N-Ras in mutant K-Ras cancer cells was associated with elevated Erk/p90RSK and Akt activation, which correlated with enhanced inhibitory phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser 280, both in the basal state and following SN38-induced DNA damage (Figures 4A and 4B). Conversely, suppression of Erk or Akt signaling via treatment with MAPK or Akt inhibitors overturned the hyperphosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser 280 in WT-H- or N-Ras-depleted mutant K-Ras cancer cells. Importantly, under these conditions, the activation of Chk1 in response to SN38-induced DNA damage was restored as shown by Chk1 Ser 317 phosphorylation (Figure 4C). Altogether, these results support a model whereby in K-Ras mutant cells, the downregulation WT-H/N-Ras leads to the enhancement of Erk/p90RSK and Akt signaling, which in turn represses Chk1 activation through Chk1 Ser 280 phosphorylation.

To rule out the possibility that WT-H/N-Ras may also specifically prevent Chk1 Ser 280 phosphorylation, we generated an isogenic derivative of the DLD1-K-RasMut cell line that can inducibly express GFP-H-RasG12V upon doxycycline administration (DLD1-K-RasMut Flip-IN TREX GFP-H-RasV12) (Girdler et al., 2006). As illustrated in Figure 4D, expression of GFP-H-RasG12V at sub-endogenous levels led to a concomitant increase in Erk and AKT signaling despite the presence of WT-H/N-Ras in these cells. Moreover, this was accompanied by the phosphorylation of Chk1 at the inhibitory site Ser 280 and an impairment of Chk1 phosphorylation at the activation sites Ser 317 and Ser 345 (Figure 4D). Altogether, our data are consistent with a model in which the enhanced phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser 280 and inhibition of Chk1 activity observed under conditions of WT-H-Ras deficiency in mutant K-Ras cells is a consequence of an increase in Erk/Akt signaling.

If the activation of Chk1 is directly linked to the presence of mutant K-Ras, then the acute expression of mutant K-Ras in an otherwise K-Ras wild-type cancer cell line should render Chk1 activation in these cells dependent on WT-H/N-Ras. To test this idea, we silenced WT-H-Ras in BxPC-3 cells (K-Ras WT) that had been engineered to inducibly express K-RasG12V (BxPC-3 K-RasV12) (Figure S4C). Whereas, knockdown of WT-H-Ras in the parental BxPC-3 cell line had no effect on Chk1 Ser 280 phosphorylation and Chk1 activation (Figures 3F and S4B), knockdown of WT-H-Ras in BxPC-3 cells induced to express K-RasG12V led to elevated Erk activation, induction of Chk1 Ser 280 phosphorylation, and impairment of Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser 317 (Figure S4D). These results suggest that the hyperactivation of Erk/Akt pathways, the enhancement of Chk1 Ser 280 phosphorylation, and the impairment of Chk1 activation induced by WT-H-Ras knockdown represent a set of responses that are specifically dictated by the mutational status of K-Ras.

Mutant K-Ras Cancer Cells Depleted of Wild-Type H- and N-Ras Are Highly Sensitive to DNA Damage-Inducing Agents
The underlying premise for the therapeutic use of DNA-damaging agents is that susceptibility of cancer cells is linked to the lack of G1/S and G2 checkpoints (Ma et al., 2011 and Zhou and Bartek, 2004). Therefore, we reasoned that the abrogation of the ATR/Chk1-induced DNA damage checkpoint in K-Ras mutant cells by WT-H- and/or N-Ras knockdown could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of DNA damaging agents. Assessment of cell viability following treatment with SN38 indicated that the K-Ras mutant cells DLD1 K-RasMut and Panc-1-expressing shRNAs targeting H-Ras were on average ∼90-fold and ∼50-fold more sensitive to SN38, respectively, as compared to DLD1 K-RasMut and Panc-1 cells expressing scramble shRNA (Figure 5A). Similarly, WT-H-Ras knockdown sensitized these cells (∼13-fold for DLD1 K-RasMut and ∼25-fold for Panc-1) to the DNA intrastrand crosslinker oxaliplatin (Figure 5B). Notably, knockdown of WT-H-Ras or N-Ras in K-Ras WT cancer cells did not lead to a sensitization to SN38 or oxaliplatin treatment (Figures 5A and 5B). Analysis of the apoptotic index, as measured by FACS detection of cleaved caspase 3-positive cells, demonstrates an exacerbation of cell death by WT-H-Ras knockdown in response to SN38 treatment (Figures 5C and 5D). Knockdown of WT-N-Ras also sensitized these cells to SN38 and oxaliplatin (Figure S5). Together, these results show that WT-H-Ras or N-Ras knockdown specifically sensitizes K-Ras Mut cancer cells to DNA damaging agents. A similar sensitization pattern was observed upon the treatment of cells with the Chk1/Chk2 inhibitor AZD7726 (Figures 6A, 6B, and S6), supporting the hypothesis that WT-H/N-Ras downregulation selectively sensitizes K-Ras mutant cells to DNA damage-inducing agents by abrogating Chk1 activity.

Knockdown of Wild-Type H-Ras Sensitizes K-Ras Mutant Tumors to DNA Damage-Inducing Chemotherapy and Leads to Tumor Regression
To test the in vivo effects of WT-H-Ras knockdown on the sensitivity of K-Ras mutant tumors to DNA damaging agents, we established xenografts of DLD1-K-Ras mutant cells that inducibly express WT-H-Ras shRNA upon exposure to doxycycline in athymic nu/nu mice. Administration of doxycycline or vehicle was initiated after tumors had reached ∼100 mm3. Seven days postinduction (tumor size ∼250 mm3), efficient knockdown of WT-H-Ras was confirmed in the established tumors, and treatment with irinotecan (CPT), a topoisomerase I inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer, was initiated (Figure S7A). In the absence of treatment with irinotecan, tumors arising from the WT-H-Ras-suppressed cells grew similarly to those arising from uninduced control cells (Figures 7A and 7B). Thus, distinct from our in vitro studies, WT-H-Ras knockdown in vivo was not associated with any delay in growth or mitotic progression under these conditions (Figures 7A, 7D, and 7E). However, similar to our observations in the synchronization studies, we did note an elevation in aberrant mitotic figures (chromosome misalignment and lagging chromosomes), which is an indication of perturbed mitosis (Figure 1G; data not shown). Hence, the lack of a higher mitotic index despite aberrant mitosis may reflect clearance of the aberrant mitotic cells in the in vivo setting. In agreement with previously reported studies, treatment with irinotecan alone resulted in a reduction of tumor growth (Figures 7A and 7B) (Harris et al., 2005 and Zabludoff et al., 2008). Notably, 5 days following the termination of irinotecan administration, WT-H-Ras-suppressed tumors had undergone regression, which was maintained for the duration of the study, up to 18 days posttreatment (Figures 7A and 7B). In contrast, the control irinotecan-treated tumors showed in large part a modest growth over the same time period (Figure S7B). Consistent with our cell-based studies, abrogation of WT-H-Ras in mutant K-Ras tumors led to Erk and Akt hyperactivation and the inhibition of Chk1 activation, as reflected by an elevated Chk1 Ser 280 phosphorylation and an impaired Chk1 Ser 317 phosphorylation in both mock and irinotecan-treated tumors (Figure 7C). Assessment of the extent of apoptosis revealed that the combination of WT-H-Ras knockdown and irinotecan treatment induced a significant increase in tumor cell apoptosis compared to WT-H-Ras knockdown or irinotecan treatment alone (Figures 7D and 7E). Importantly, irinotecan treatment failed to induce cell-cycle arrest of WT-H-Ras-suppressed tumors as evident by the significant increase in the number of cells staining positive for phosphorylated histone H3 compared to WT-H-Ras-intact tumors (Figures 7D and 7E). These results indicate that WT-H-Ras knockdown in K-Ras mutant cells compromises the DNA damage checkpoint-mediated cell-cycle arrest in vivo.

To further substantiate the in vivo analyses of the consequences of WT-H-Ras knockdown, we administered irinotecan or vehicle to xenograft tumors derived from either MIA PaCa-2 (K-Ras Mutant) or BxPC-3 (K-Ras WT) cells that were engineered to inducibly (+Dox) express WT-H-Ras shRNA (Figures S7C and S7D). Similar to DLD1-K-RasMut xenografts, combination of WT-H-Ras knockdown and irinotecan treatment led to MIA PaCa-2 tumor regression, but irinotecan alone led to a growth delay and WT-H-Ras knockdown alone had no effect (Figure S7C). Importantly, we found no synergy between WT-H-Ras knockdown and irinotecan treatment in BxPC-3 xenograft tumors (Figure S7D). Collectively, these observations establish a role for WT-H-Ras in maintaining a functional Chk1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint in established K-Ras mutant tumors.

Discussion
Effective targeting of oncogenic K-Ras-driven tumors has remained a major challenge in cancer therapy. Considerable evidence indicates that cancer cells develop dependencies on normal functions of certain genes that can potentially be exploited to improve therapeutic strategies (De Raedt et al., 2011, Kumar et al., 2012, Luo et al., 2009a and Luo et al., 2009b). In the present study, we demonstrate that K-Ras mutant cancers display a dependency on WT-H/N-Ras for the activation of the ATR/Chk1-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) and therefore can be sensitized to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics through the suppression of WT-H/N-Ras. The activation of DDR has been shown to play distinct context-dependent roles in the course of malignant transformation (Toledo et al., 2011a). In premalignant lesions, DDR activation is triggered by oncogenic stress and commonly leads to cell death or senescence, thereby functioning as an intrinsic barrier to malignancy (Bartkova et al., 2005, Gilad et al., 2010 and Schoppy et al., 2012). Full malignant transformation, however, is accompanied by a weakening of the DDR barrier through the selective acquisition of mutations within critical DDR signaling modules (for example, p53 mutations and abrogation of ATM/Chk2/p53 signaling). As such, advanced tumors become highly reliant on the remaining functional DDR pathway (ATR/Chk1) for coping with the high levels of oncogene-induced genotoxic stress. In this context, the role of WT-H/N-Ras in coordinating the activation of ATR/Chk1 is critical for supporting the tumorigenic phenotype of K-Ras mutant tumors by preventing catastrophic DNA damage and enhancing tumorigenic fitness and survival. Consistent with this model, wild-type Ras has been shown to play a tumor-promoting role in cell lines from established tumors (Young et al., 2012).

Our results identify a role for WT-H/N-Ras in facilitating Chk1 activation by suppressing the Erk/p90RSK and PI3K/Akt pathways that inhibit Chk1 via Ser 280 phosphorylation. The capacity of WT-Ras to negatively regulate effector pathway signaling in mutant Ras cancer cells is consistent with earlier reports showing that the levels of WT-Ras proteins in mutant Ras cancer cell lines are inversely correlated to the activation status of Ras-effector molecules (Young et al., 2012 and Zhang et al., 2001). It is noteworthy that the knockdown of wild-type isoform alone is sufficient to hyperactivate Erk and Akt and inhibit Chk1 activity and checkpoint function. This suggests a tightly controlled threshold for the WT-H/N-Ras-mediated attenuation of Ras-effector signaling in mutant K-Ras cancers. The mechanisms underlying the WT-H/N-Ras-mediated antagonism of Ras effector signaling in mutant K-Ras cancers remain to be delineated. Of potential relevance to this question are the seemingly contradictory observations that whereas the knockdown of WT-H/N-Ras in mutant K-Ras cancer cells induces Erk and Akt hyperactivation, the knockdown of Sos1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras GTPases, instead impairs Erk and Akt activity (Jeng et al., 2012). A fundamental difference between these two scenarios is that whereas Sos knockdown would affect the levels of GTP-bound Ras, the knockdown of WT-H/N-Ras would inevitably lessen both GDP and GTP-bound Ras levels. Because the WT-isoforms exist predominantly in the GDP-bound form, knockdown of WT-H/N-Ras is likely to significantly alter the stoichiometry of GDP- to GTP-Ras molecules. This may provide a plausible explanation for the observed hyperactivation of Erk and Akt, as GDP-bound Ras molecules have been suggested to play an inhibitory role in Ras signaling (Singh et al., 2005). Furthermore, in the case of Raf, activation depends on Ras-mediated homo- and/or heterodimerization of Raf proteins, which likely require at least two Ras-GTP molecules (Heidorn et al., 2010, Inouye et al., 2000, Poulikakos et al., 2011, Rushworth et al., 2006 and Weber et al., 2001). Because Ras dimerization appears to be constitutive and nonselective for GDP or GTP-bound Ras, depletion of GDP-bound Ras, as in the case of knockdown of WT-H-Ras or N-Ras, would stoichiometrically favor Ras-GTP dimer formation and consequently lead to Raf hyperactivation (Heidorn et al., 2010 and Inouye et al., 2000).

There is now a large body of pre-clinical evidence showing that inhibition of the ATR/Chk1 pathway enhances the efficacy of standard chemotherapy. Indeed, several Chk1 inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials (Ma et al., 2012). As such, the ability of WT-H/N-Ras to determine Chk1 activation in mutant K-Ras tumors may warrant further exploration into the development of a therapeutic approach that utilizes inhibition of wild-type Ras-ATR/Chk1 signaling in combination with DNA damaging agents for the selective targeting of K-Ras-driven cancers.

Experimental Procedures
Cell Culture and Lentiviral Transduction
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1, PL45, AsPC-1, CFPAC-1, MIA PaCa-2, BxPC-3, and Hs700T were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The isogenic colon cancer cells DLD1-K-RasMut and DLD1-K-RasKO were a kind gift from Dr. Mark Philips. Lentiviral particles were generated in accordance with standard protocols. For knockdown experiments, cells were transduced with lentiviral particles (multiplicity of infections [moi] for Hs700T, 15; all other cell lines, 7) containing pTripz scramble shRNA, H-Ras shRNA, or N-Ras shRNA and selected with puromycin (Calbiochem; for AsPC-1, 4 μg/ml; for all others, 2 μg/ml) for 3 days. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed on day 4 of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) induction. DLD1 K-RasMut Flip-IN TREX GFP-H-RasV12 cells were generated through Flp recombinase-mediated homologous recombination between the FRT sites in the DLD1 K-RasMut cell line and the pcDNA3/FRT/TO/GFP-HRasG12V expression vector. To generate BxPC-3-K-RasV12 cells, BxPC-3 cells were transduced with a TET-inducible lentiviral vector to express K-RasG12V, pLenti-TO-K-RasG12V (moi = 1). Following puromycin selection, cells that had efficiently integrated the K-RasG12V lentiviral construct (BxPC-3-K-RasV12) were expanded and subsequently transduced with a pTRIPZ-H-Ras sh construct. As both vectors are Dox inducible, induction of the expression of K-RasV12 also induces the knockdown of WT-H-Ras. Following a 48 hr induction, BxPC-3-K-RasV12 cells that also expressed the H-Ras sh were obtained by fluorescent sorting (RFP: pTRIPZ-H-Ras sh also expresses RFP upon Dox induction). The obtained cells were then cultured for an additional 48 hr in the presence of Dox and assayed for Chk1 activation upon treatment with SN38.

Cell Viability Assays
For viability assays, cells were treated with doxycycline to induce shRNA expression for 4 days and then seeded at a density of 4,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate in doxycycline containing media. Twenty-four hours postplating, SN-38 (Tocris Biosciences), oxaliplatin (Tocris Biosciences), or vehicle was added. Following a 72 hr treatment, cell viability was assessed by the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; Sigma-Aldrich) assay in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Viable fraction is expressed as the percentage of vehicle-treated control cells. EC50 was calculated using Graphpad Prism (v. 4.0) software.

Cell Synchronization and Flow Cytometry
Cells were synchronized at the G1/S transition by a double thymidine block. Cells were treated with 2 mM thymidine for 22 hr and released from thymidine block by washing twice with PBS, followed by incubation in fresh medium. Fourteen hours after release, thymidine was added for another 20 hr. Induction of H-Ras shRNA expression was initiated with the first thymidine block. For the G2/M checkpoint analysis in response to UV-C, cells were irradiated with UV-C (25 J/m2) during the exponential growth phase. Cells were harvested 1, 2, and 3 hr later, fixed with ice-cold 80% ethanol/PBS, and incubated overnight at −20°C. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100/PBS on ice for 10 min. Cells were stained with anti-phospho histone H3 to detect mitotic cells and TO-PRO 3 for DNA content. For G2/M checkpoint activation in response to SN-38, cells were treated with 4 nM SN-38 and fixed at the indicated time points. Staining for cleaved caspase 3-positive cells was performed using the Nucview-488 Caspase 3 Kit (Biotium). Flow cytometry was performed on an LSRII (BD Biosciences) at NYU School of Medicine Flow Cytometry Core Facility, and data were analyzed using FlowJo software.

Animal Studies
For xenograft studies, we subcutaneously implanted 2 × 106 DLD1 K-RasMut, MIA PaCa-2, or BxPC-3 cells stable for pTripz-H-Ras shRNA (1:1 in Matrigel, BD Biosciences) in both flanks of 8-week-old female athymic nude (NCRNU, Taconic) mice. When tumor size reached ∼100 mm3, mice were given drinking water containing either doxycycline (0.2 mg/ml)/0.5% sucrose or 0.5% sucrose alone. Water was replaced every 3 days. Tumor volume was determined using electronic calipers to measure length (l), width (w), and the formula (w2 × l)/2. Tumor volume was measured twice a week. We treated mice bearing H-Ras-depleted (dox/sucrose) or H-Ras-intact (sucrose) DLD1 K-RasMut tumors with either irinotecan or vehicle, once tumors reached 250 mm3. Irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT) powder was dissolved into solution as previously described (Harris et al., 2005 and Zabludoff et al., 2008). This solution was diluted with 5% dextrose for intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at a dose of 50 mg/kg every other day for 3 rounds of treatment (q2 dx3). Irinotecan, or the combinatorial H-Ras knockdown and irinotecan treatments, were well tolerated as no weight loss above 10% body mass was observed. Body mass was measured using an electronic scale every 2 days. The percent change in tumor volume from day 0 of irinotecan treatment to tumor volume 5 days after the last dose of irinotecan administration was measured. Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide-induced narcosis. To prepare lysates, tumor tissue was homogenized in RIPA buffer and sonicated to shear genomic DNA. All animal work was approved by New York University Langone Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed by the Graphpad Prism built-in test (unpaired, two-tailed), and results were considered significant at p < 0.05.

Movie S2. K-Ras Mutant Cancer Cells Require WT-H-Ras for the Timely Progression through Mitosis.  

Panc-1 cells induced to express a WT-H-Ras shRNA were monitored as in Movie S1. Most WT-HRas ablated cells were delayed in prometaphase/metaphase, and took on average 2-3 times longer to progress to anaphase. A similar delay was also observed in anaphase/cytokinesis completion. This delay, together with the chromatin aberrations observed, similar to those shown for DLD1-K-RasMut cells in Figure 1G, suggest a failure to satisfy the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC).
