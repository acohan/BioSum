The manuscript by Kumar et al.,  authors investigated the role of GATA2 in Kras mutant non-small cells lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and found that GATA2 is essential for the viability of ras-pathway  mutant NSCLC, thus authors used small-interfering RNAs (siRNA) against both Kras and GATA2 in the NSCLC cells A549 (KRAS mutant), PC9 (EGFR mutant), and H322M (WT). Moreover, GATA2 is necessary for oncogene driven lung cancer growth in in vivo. Moreover, GATA2 also regulates NF-κB signaling through IL-1 pathway, Rho target genes via a STAT5 transcriptional complex. Loss of GATA2 induced regression in established Kras mutant lung tumors. Though cellular and genetic studies reveal a dependency on GATA2 for ras-pathway mutant NSCLC, however it is difficult of targeting transcriptional factors with small molecules into the clinical setting. Importantly, present studies revealed a GATA2-regulated signaling can be inhibited with clinical available compounds like bortezomib (NF-κB inhibitor) and fasudil (Rho/ROCK signaling inhibition). Authors also used combination of these inhibitors for the combined inhibition of these pathways on Kras mutant NSCLC. Considering the effects observed with this regimen, authors believe such a strategy may benefit patients with ras-pathway mutant NSCLC. Results from the present study have been cited in the several manuscripts like as:  loss of GATA2 inhibited cell viability; looking for a agents that could specifically kill Kras mutant cells, knockdown of GATA2 was synthetically lethal with Kras mutation; GATA2 transcriptional factor, which is essential for oncogenic Kras dependent lung tumor development, binds to the TRAF6 promoter and enhances its expression.
