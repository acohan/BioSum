The manuscript by Kumar et al. 2012 describes the investigation of the GATA2 transcription factor and its significance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Kras mutant NSCLC cells require GATA2 for survival. In vivo, the authors found that GATA2 is crucial for tumorgenesis in RAS-pathway mutant lung cancer. GATA2 knockdown completely abrogated tumor formation for up to 9 months. Loss of IL-1 or NF-kB had no effect on cell viability, but inhibition of both caused modest reduction in viability. In addition, activation of the Rho pathway is sufficient to rescue viability in response to GATA2, but is not solely necessary for mutant NSCLC survival. Using clinically available inhibitors of proteasome and Rho signaling was found to robustly suppress kras mutant tumor growth. This is the first manuscript to show that NSCLC cells with Ras-pathway mutations depend on the transcription factor, GATA2. Most intriguing is that reduction of GATA2 reduced tumor development and combined suppression of GATA2-regulated pathways with clinically approved inhibitors caused tumor clearance. The results and implications of this manuscript were cited including genes in the Rho-signaling pathway is occupied by GATA2 in mutant Kras cells, but not wild type, combined inhibitors selective for two of the GATA2 regulated pathways treat mice with kras-driven NSCLC, reduction of GATA2 inhibits cell viability, and GATA2 binds the TRAF6 promoter to enhance its expression. One manuscript cited the methods in this article namely that NSCLC cell lines were screened with wild type or mutant kras with an RNAi library against 7000 genes.
