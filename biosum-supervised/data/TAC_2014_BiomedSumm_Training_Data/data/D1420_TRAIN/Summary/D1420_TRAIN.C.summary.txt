Inhibition of certain genes which directly regulate cancer has given rise to a number of strategies to treat KRAS mutant cancers. Here Kumar et al., 2012 report the importance of the GATA2 transcriptional network in RAS oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by screening of human NSCLC cell lines carrying either wild-type or mutant KRAS with an RNAi library against 7,000 human genes. The authors report transcription factor GATA2 essential for the proliferation of cell lines carrying oncogenic KRAS using cell viability as the biological read-out. In PC9 cells, loss of GATA2 and EGFR inhibited cell viability showing that GATA2 is essential for the survival of RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC. This was confirmed by complete abrogation of tumor formation by GATA2 knockdown cells in vivo. Mechanistically, GATA2 regulated proteasome via Nrf1 control and NFkB signaling through IL-1 pathway. By CHIP-PCR they identified that some genes involved in RHO-related signaling pathways were occupied by GATA2 in KRAS mutant but not wild type tumor cells because of which GATA2 knockdown in KRAS mutant cells resulted in a striking reduction of active GTP-bound RHO proteins. Furthermore, GATA2 was found to be necessary for oncogenic Kras-driven lung tumor formation and its ablation showed major regression in established Kras mutant lesions. Combination treatment with available inhibitors (bortezomib and  fasudil), selective for NF-kB and Rho signaling pathway, demonstrated substantial regression of Kras mutant tumor. Since GATA2 itself is unlikely druggable, this study reports its role in RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC and proposes therapeutic approaches that appear very promising.
