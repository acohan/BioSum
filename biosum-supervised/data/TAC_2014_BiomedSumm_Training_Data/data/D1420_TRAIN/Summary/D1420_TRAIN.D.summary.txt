Kumar et al 2012 show that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with the RAS-pathway mutant, are dependent on the transcription factor GATA2. The most frequently mutated oncogenes in NSCLC are the RAS family of GTPases and various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), comprising of nearly half of all NSCLCs.Human NSCLC cell lines carrying either wild-type or mutant KRAS were screened with an RNAi library against 7,000 human genes revealing that loss of GATA2 led to a decrease in KRAS mutant cell viability. Further analysis of NSCLC cell lines shows GATA2 is required in KRAS-pathway mutant NSCLC. PC9 cells (EGFR mutant) were also dependent on GATA2 for viability. KRAS mutant NSCLC is dependent on GATA2 through its regulation of the proteasome machinery, IL-1-signaling, and Rho-signaling pathways. GATA2 also enhances the expression of TRAF6.In mouse models, the ablation of GATA2 leads reduced tumor development. Furthermore, GATA2 deletion in established Kras mutant tumors induced striking regression due to reduced viability of NSCLC cells, whereas wild-type cells were unaffected. As GATA2 itself is likely undruggable, its role in regulating the proteasome together with IL-1 and Rho-signalling suggests a therapeutic approach. When the clinically approved inhibitors bortezomib and fasudil are administered in the mouse model, dramatic tumor inhibition is shown due to the combined suppression of these GATA2-regulated pathways.The evidence indicates that cancer cells develop dependencies on normal functions of certain genes that can potentially be exploited to improve therapeutic strategies.
