BAF53 shows extensive homology with actin and actin-related proteins Act2 and Act3. In addition, after we completed this work, the yeast genome project was completed, revealing two open reading frames in yeast, YPR034w and YMR033w ( Figure 3A), encoding BAF53 homologs ... Actin was coimmunoprecipitated by all of the antibodies against subunits of the BAF complex (lanes 1, 2, and 3), but not by antibodies to other nuclear proteins (lanes 4, 5, 6, and 7). To more rigorously examine the presence of β-actin in the BAF complex, we used a cell line stably transfected with HA-tagged BAF57. The HA antibody immunoprecipitated actin only from the nuclear extracts derived from the HA BAF57 cell line but not from its parent cell line (compare lanes 8 and 9 in Figure 4B). Using antibodies to hISWI/hSNF2L, we found no evidence of actin in these complexes (data not shown) ...
