Zhao et al. demonstrated that the activation of T lymphocytes of transgenic mice is accompanied by a visible changes in the BAF complex with chromatin. B-actin and a novel actin-related protein, BAF53, (subunits in mammalian SWI/SNF complex) have been identified in the BAF chromatin-remodeling complex. These two subunits have been shown that are required for remodeling activity of BAF complex and targeting to chromatin. Phosphatidyl Inositol 4,5-Bisphosphate (PIP2) enhances the binding of BAF complexes to the nuclear scaffold/matrix and chromatin, enhances the T cells stimulation. BAF53, the 53 kDa subunit of the BAF complex is an actin-related protein. BRG1 has been shown that is required for the assembly of b-actin (a subunit of the BAF complex) and BAF53 into the BAF complex. B-actin, and BAF53 directly bound to BRG1. A citing paper referred to Latrunculin B and its action on BRG1 activity. Latrunculin B, a well-characterized molecule that inhibits the actions of actin by sequestering actin monomers, blocks the ATPase activation of the BAF complex by interfering with the actions of actin on the ATPase activity of BRG1. B-actin and BAF53 have been appeared to perform a weak ATPase activities. They contribute about 1% of the total ATPase activity in the BAF remodeling complex. In conclusion, authors in this work demonstrated that ~90% of SWI/SNF complexes are associated with the action of b-actin. However, there is a need for assays that could be used to learn the mechanism that underlie these rapid, signal-related changes in BAF the complex and chromatin.
