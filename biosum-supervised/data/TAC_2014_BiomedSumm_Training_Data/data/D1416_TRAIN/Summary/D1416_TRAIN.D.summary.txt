Zhao et al. 1998 establish the signaling pathway activated upon stimulating lymphocytes by antigen presentation. After stimulating lymphocytes with antigen presentation in just 10 minutes, 90% of the SWI/SNF-like BAF complex becomes tightly associated with the nucleus with visible chromatin remodeling. They find that signals from the lymphocyte antigen receptor induces a rapid association of the BAF complex with chromatin. β-actin and the actin related protein BAF53 are are the functional subunits of the BAF complex, both ∼50 kDa in size. β-actin and BAF53 are required for stimulation of the ATPase activity of the BAF complex by chromatin although actin was also found to have weak ATPase activity, since actin contributes only about 1% of the total ATPase activity of the intact BAF remodeling complex. Results of experiments using the actin monomer sequestering product latrunculin B suggest that actin is in its monomeric state.The association of chromatin with β-actin and BAF53 the BAF complex occurs only in the presence of BRG1. They demonstrate that actin and BAF53 directly interact with BRG1 in the BAF complex in vitro, since the cross-linking was sufficiently inefficient to detect interactions mediated by a third protein. BRG1 is targeted to the nuclear matrix/chromatin through direct interaction with nuclear Phosphatidyl Inositol 4,5-Bisphosphate (PIP2). When PIP2 is activated by antigen presentation it regulates the binding of BAF complexes to the nuclear scaffold/matrix and chromatin and also regulates actin function by displacing actin-binding proteins from actin.
