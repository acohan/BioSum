The manuscript by Zhao et al. 1998 describes the proteins involved in the SWI/SNF-like BAF complex a chromatin remodeling complex after activation of lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) upon antigen presentation. After stimulating lymphocytes with antigen presentation in just 10 minutes, 90% of the BAF complex became tightly associated with the nucleus. Using a nuclear retention assay, the authors also found that phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphophaste (PIP2) is required for BAF complexes to bind chromatin and the nuclear matrix. Interestingly, the authors identified actin as a requirement for the BAF complex and that association of actin and BAF53 with chromatin requires BRG1. Actin was also found to have ATPase activity, which accounted for 1% of the total ATPase activity of the chromatin remodeling complex. The following results and implications were cited by other manuscripts including BAF53 is present in chromatin remodeling complexes, Act1 is found in chromatin remodeling complexes, BAF53 and B-actin play a role in signal-regulated binding to chromatin/nuclear matrix, ptdlnsP2 induces association of BAF complex with chromatin/nuclear matrix in T cells, actin proteins have weak ATPase activity, Latrunculin B-based assays found that B-actin and BAFs are required for ATPase activity of chromatin remodeling complex, actin molecule is required to bind chromatin and activate transcription, chromatin complex targets nuclear matrix by interacting with PIP2 and actin/actin-related protein.  The final implications of this manuscript are that PIP2 targets the BAF complex to move to the nucleus and b-actin as well as BAF53 are required with BRG1 for association of the complex with chromatin.
