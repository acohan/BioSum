It has been known that lymphocyte activation is accompanied by visible changes in chromatin structure. In the manuscript by Zhao et al., 1998, authors found that antigen receptor signaling induces the fast association of the BAF complex with chromatin. Within 10 min of activation, the BAF complex becomes strongly associated with the nuclei of lymphocytes. Moreover, BAF complex interaction with chromatin nuclei is enhanced by phosphatidyl inositol 4, 5- bisphosphate (PIP2) as PIP2 enhances the nuclear retention of BAF complexes in lymphocytes. Actin has the ATPase activity, which accounted for 1% of the total ATPase activity of the chromatin remodeling complex. The findings of the reference manuscript were cited by various manuscripts as follows:  β-actin has been shown to be a subunit of mammalian SWI/SNF and could be required for its regulation and targeting to chromatin, cellular actin, Act1, a protein recently found in mammalian SWI/SNF,  β-actin and actin related proteins appear to have weak ATPase activities, which contribute ∼1% of the total activity in the BAF remodeling complex, β-actin and BAF53 are required for stimulation of the ATpase activity of the BAF complex by chromatin, actin molecule binds to chromatin and activates the transcription, chromatin complex interacting with PIP2 and actin related proteins to targets nuclear matrix. The findings of  reference  manuscript  are that  BAF complex involves in chromatin remodeling, contain actin-related proteins , and are rapidly targeted to chromatin and the nuclear scaffold or matrix by a PIP2-dependent mechanism define a direct interface between chromatin and signal transduction.
