In their active conformation G proteins interact with effector proteins, which induce downstream signaling events. The GDP-GTP cycle is highly regulated by GEFs that induce the release of the bound GDP to be replaced by the more abundant GTP and by GAPs that usually provide an essential catalytic group for GTP hydrolysis ... For a subset of small G proteins (mainly for Rab and Rho proteins) guanine nucleotide-dissociation inhibitors provide an additional level of control. These proteins remove small G proteins from membranes by sequestration of their lipid tails | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

In general the affinity of the G protein for GTP and GDP is similar, and the GEF does not favor rebinding of GDP or GTP. Thus the resulting increase in GTP-bound over GDP-bound is due to the approximately ten times higher cellular concentration of GTP compared to GDP. As shown first for the interaction between the RanGEF RCC1 and Ran the affinities of the binary complexes between the G protein and either the nucleotide or its GEF are very high. In contrast, the affinities of the exchange factor for the nucleotide-bound G protein and of the nucleotide for the exchange-factor-bound G protein (the ternary complexes) are much lower (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001). Thus, the interaction of a GEF weakens the affinity for the nucleotide, and visa versa, the nucleotide weakens the affinity for the GEF. In the course of the exchange reaction the GEF displaces the bound nucleotide, and subsequently a new nucleotide displaces the GEF (Figure 2A) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

In addition to the catalytic Sec7 domain both groups contain a PH domain. The activity of the large ArfGEFs was found to be inhibited by the natural compound Brefeldin A, resulting in the collapse of the Golgi structure. Brefeldin A stabilizes the ternary ARF-GDP-GEF complex and thus traps the GEF in an unproductive complex with its substrate. Structural analysis revealed that Brefeldin A binds at the binding interface between the Sec7 domain and Arf1 and thereby stabilizes the interaction (Renault et al., 2003). An elegant approach to identify inhibitors for GEFs was recently reported for the small ArfGEFs. M69 was identified in a library of RNA aptomers due to its ability to inhibit Cytohesin-1 activity in vitro (Mayer et al., 2001). Subsequently, a chemical library was screened for molecules that could compete with M69 for binding to Cytohesin-1 resulting in identification of SecinH3. SecinH3 inhibited the ARNO and Cytohesin-1 with an IC50 in the low micromolar range in vitro. Interestingly, using this inhibitor it was found that cytohesins play a role in insulin signaling, demonstrating its applicability for in vivo systems (Hafner et al., 2006) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

The G-protein-bound nucleotide is sandwiched between two loops called switch 1 and switch 2. The switch regions together with the phosphate-binding loop (P loop) interact with the phosphates and a coordinating magnesium ion. Both phosphates and the magnesium ion are essential for the high-affinity binding of the nucleotide to the G protein (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001). The action of the GEF on the G protein was analyzed in several structural studies. Due to the inherent instability of the ternary complexes most structural studies have been performed with stable binary complexes between GEFs and G proteins (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998, Worthylake et al., 2000, Renault et al., 2001, Goldberg, 1998 and Itzen et al., 2006). These have revealed that the catalytic domains of the various families of GEFs are structurally unrelated and approach the G proteins from different angles (Figure 2B). However, they all use similar principles to deform the nucleotide-binding site. GEF binding induces conformational changes in the switch regions and the P loop, while leaving the remainder of the structure largely unperturbed | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |
