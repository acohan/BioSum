GEFs catalyze the dissociation of the nucleotide from the G protein by modifying the nucleotide-binding site such that the nucleotide affinity is decreased and, thus, the nucleotide is released and subsequently replaced ... First insight into GAP-assisted GTP hydrolysis was obtained from the biochemistry and structure of the Ras-RasGAP complex (Scheffzek et al., 1997). RasGAP stabilizes the position of glutamine 61 of Ras, which in turn coordinates the attacking water | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

A characteristic of GEFs is their strong preference for binding nucleotide-free over nucleotide-loaded GTPases (Bos et al., 2007; Feig, 1999) | Reference Offset:  ['6833-7052', '7723-8002'] | Reference Text:  GEFs catalyze the dissociation of the nucleotide from the G protein by modifying the nucleotide-binding site such that the nucleotide affinity is decreased and, thus, the nucleotide is released and subsequently replaced ... Thus, the interaction of a GEF weakens the affinity for the nucleotide, and visa versa, the nucleotide weakens the affinity for the GEF. In the course of the exchange reaction the GEF displaces the bound nucleotide, and subsequently a new nucleotide displaces the GEF (Figure 2A) | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

In this review, we will highlight the molecular mechanisms by which small G proteins are regulated by GEFs and GAPs ... Because exchange of GDP for GTP and, thus, activation of G proteins in biological processes occur within minutes or even less, exchange of GDP for GTP requires the activity of GEFs | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

The G-protein-bound nucleotide is sandwiched between two loops called switch 1 and switch 2. The switch regions together with the phosphate-binding loop (P loop) interact with the phosphates and a coordinating magnesium ion ... However, they all use similar principles to deform the nucleotide-binding site. GEF binding induces conformational changes in the switch regions and the P loop, while leaving the remainder of the structure largely unperturbed | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

In their active conformation G proteins interact with effector proteins, which induce downstream signaling events.
