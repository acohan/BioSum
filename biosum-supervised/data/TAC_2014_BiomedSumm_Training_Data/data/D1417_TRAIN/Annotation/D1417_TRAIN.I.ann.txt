Thus, although the various GEFs are not conserved, their common action is to deform the phosphate-binding site, resulting in a reduced affinity of the nucleotide ... Although G proteins are also called GTPases, the actual GTP hydrolysis reaction is in fact very slow, and efficient hydrolysis requires the interaction with a GAP, which accelerates the cleavage step by several orders of magnitude | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  I, |

RCC1 uses a β-turn on top of a β-propeller for insertion into the nucleotide-binding site (Renault et al., 2001), whereas MSS4 binds via one of its β strands to switch 1 and thereby forms an intermolecular β sheet (Itzen et al., 2006; Figure 2B) ... In all these cases the interaction of the GEF sterically occludes the magnesium-binding site either by residues of the GEF or by the repositioning of the alanine side chain from the conserved DTAG motif of switch 2. This perturbs the interaction surface in the phosphate-binding region while leaving the base-binding region mostly unperturbed | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  I, |

In most GAPs, such as Ras-, Rho, and RabGAPs, a so-called arginine finger is introduced into the active site of their cognate G protein, stabilizing the transition state (Bos et al., 2007) | Reference Offset:  ['15167-15353', '15848-16083', '16085-16442'] | Reference Text:  In addition, an arginine, called the arginine finger, is positioned into the phosphate-binding site and stabilizes the transition state by neutralizing negative charge at the γ-phosphate ... A similar mechanism was found for RhoGAP-assisted hydrolysis (Rittinger et al., 1997) even though RasGAP and RhoGAP are not related in terms of primary structure and are only distantly related in terms of tertiary structure (Figure 3B) ... The catalytic glutamine of Ras and Rho is also conserved in Rab, and the arginine finger is observed in RabGAP, but the mechanism is somewhat different. In this case the glutamine that orients the water is supplied by the GAP, and the glutamine of Rab is pointing away from the active site and is involved in the binding of GAP (Pan et al., 2006; Figure 3B) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  I, |
