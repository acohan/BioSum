Bos et al 2007 review the role of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) in the regulation of small guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins. Small G proteins are typically between 20–25 kDa in size and cycle between an inactive GDP-bound conformation and an active GTP-bound conformation. In their active conformation G proteins interact with effector proteins, inducing downstream signaling events to control cellular functions. GEFs and GAPs regulate GDP-GTP cycle with GEFs activating the G proteins and GAPs promoting inactivation by stimulating GTP hydrolysis. They are both multidomain proteins that are regulated by extracellular signals and localized cues that control cellular events.GEFs turn on signaling by catalyzing the exchange from G-protein-bound GDP to more abundant GTP. All known GEFs reconfigure the nucleotide-binding pocket, often opening it by rearranging the switch regions. In most GAPs, such as Ras-, Rho, and RabGAPs, a so-called arginine finger is introduced into the active site of their G protein, stabilizing the transition state. Alternatively stabilization is Ca2+-mediated. GAPs provide an essential catalytic group by inducing GTP hydrolysis to terminate signaling.  The small G-protein Ras, is mutated in 15% of all human tumors. The amino acid substitutions at codons 12, 13, or 61, result in oncogenic Ras proteins that accumulate in the active, GTP-bound conformation because of defective guanine nucleotide hydrolysis. GEFs and GAPs proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for developing drugs to treat various diseases, including cancer.
