	Bos et al., 2007 reviews the function of GEFs and GAPs in the regulation of small G protein families and examines their mechanisms through known examples. GEFs and GAPs serve essential regulatory roles by controlling the activity of small G proteins. GEFs, or guanine exchange factors, are able to activate small G proteins by replacing GDP with GTP to activate small G proteins. GEFs accomplish this by binding to G proteins and modifying the nucleotide binding site. Additionally GEFs bind with higher affinity to the nucleotide free state thus triggering nucelotide release upon interaction with the G protein. GAPs, or GTPase activating proteins, on the other hand enhance hydrolysis of GTP in order to turn off G proteins. This catalytic reaction while different among different GAPs, depends on a few overlapping characteristics. These include the proper orientation and polarization of an attacking H2O molecule, occlusion of additional molecules from the active site, and stabilization of the transition state. Many GAPs contain an arginine finger that is needed for transition state stabilization. GEFs and GAPs themselves can be regulated in a number of ways to control the spatial and temporal regulation of G proteins. These regulatory strategies include translocation to specific cellular compartments, inhibition of activity through protein-protein interactions, post-translational modification, and autoinhibition through flanking protein regions. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms may help identify suitable drug targets. The control of G protein activity by GEFs and GAPs represents a potential therapeutic opportunity for treatment of cancers with aberrant G protein signaling.
