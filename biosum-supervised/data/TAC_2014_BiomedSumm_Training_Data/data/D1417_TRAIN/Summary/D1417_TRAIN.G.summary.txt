The review article by Bos et al. 2007 describes the investigation of the mechanism of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAFs) in regulating GTPase proteins. They describe GEFs and GAPs as multi-domain proteins in the Rho, Ras, Rab, Ran, and Arf family of proteins. The general mechanism of GEFs involves catalyzing the dissociation of the nucleotide from the G protein by inducing conformational changes in the switch regions and the P loop, while leaving the remainder of the protein unperturbed. GAPs assist in the GTP hydrolysis reaction and accelerates the cleavage step by several orders of magnitude. An arginine in the Ras protein forms an arginine finger that is positioned into the phosphate-binding site and stabilizes the transition state to make the reaction occur faster (lower energy usage). The results and implications of the manuscript were cited including GEFs and GAPs enhance nucleotide binding and hydrolysis of GTPases, GEFs bind nucleotide free over nucleotide bound GTPases, GEFs reconfigure the nucleotide binding site, Arginine finger is introduced into the active site of the G protein to stabilize the transition state, Ras-like G-proteins require GEF and GAP proteins to drive nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis, and Ras mutations at positions 12, 13, and 61 cause Ras proteins to accumulate in active GTP bound conformation due to defective guanidine nucleotide hydrolysis. One manuscript stated that the pH for their reaction was lower than that of typical GAP reactions; however this manuscript did not mention anything about the pH of the reaction.
