In this work, Bos et al., reviewed the molecular mechanisms of the regulation of small G proteins (also called GTPase) by GEFs (Guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and GAPs (GTPase activating proteins) and discussed how these activities are controlled in different cases. GEFs acts as a catalyst to modify the nucleotide-binding site of a G protein resulting in a release and relapse of nucleotide. The rearrangement happens in the switch regions and the P loop. Many GEFs facilitate this process by inserting a protein called “wedge” into either the magnesium or the nucleotide-binding site. This action only disturb the phosphate-binding region but the base-binding region stays unperturbed. GEFs have stronger affinity for binding the nucleotide-free than binding nucleotide-bound GTPase. The function of other small GTPase inhibitors such as Arf is critically depends on the activity of the GEFs. The actual GTP hydrolysis is very slow and it requires the interaction with a GAP to accelerate the cleavage step by several orders of magnitude. The mechanism of GAP-induced GTP hydrolysis is based on the Ras-RasGAP complex. An arginine aka arginine finger stabilizes the transition state by binding into the phosphate-binding site. As an example, the mutation of glutamine 61, which frequently reported in human tumors, is happened at the position 12 and 13 of Ras which change the orientation of arginine as well as the glutamine 61. In conclusion, it should be beneficial to study GEDs and GAPs in more detail as therapeutic candidates and clarify their molecular mechanism of the activation.
