Recently, the importance of metabolic transformation in cancer development has captured the interest. Ying et al. generated an in vivo model and showed that oncogenic Kras gene is essential for maintenance the tumor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To do so, authors crossed iKras and conditional p53 knockout (p53L) alleles in a mouse model. The progress of ODAC was observed in 8/8 iKras p53L/+ mice after induction at 8 weeks. The result revealed that the expression of Kras alone is sufficient for the tumor progression whereas the extinction of the mutant Kras from tumors led the regression of stromal elements starting after 48 hrs and achieving a peak at 72 hrs after doxy withdrawl. Gfpt1, the first and rate-limiting step of HBP, has been identified as an important contributor to Kras-independent PDAC. In PDAC mouse model, Gfpt1 showed a supportive role for Kras activation in anabolic glucose metabolism and tumor growth by downregualtion of KrasG12D and reduction of overall O-linked glycosylation. In this mouse model for Kras-dependent PDA, it also has been identified that oncogenic Kras induces ribonucleotide biosynthesis through the enhancement of the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathways (PPP). A trace of incorporation of individual glucose carbons were observe. One paper mentioned Kras as “master regulator” in PDA development. In conclusion, Kras has been shown to be a potential candidate for further study as a therapeutic in PDAC. Also, the mechanism by which oncogenic Kras coordinate the shift in metabolic pathways are remain areas of active investigation.
