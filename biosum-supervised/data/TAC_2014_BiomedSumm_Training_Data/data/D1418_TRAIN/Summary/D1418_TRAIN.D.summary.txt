Ying et al 2012 demonstrate that oncogenic Kras serves a critical role in the tumor initiation and maintenance of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PADC) and serves a vital role in controlling tumor metabolism by shunting glucose metabolism towards anabolic pathways.The malignant progression from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) to invasive and metastatic disease is accompanied by the early acquisition of activating mutations in the KRAS oncogene. In this study, an inducible KrasG12D p53+/− mouse model of pancreatic cancer is studied as it allows tissue-specific, inducible expression of mutant Kras in combination with a loss of function allele of the tumor suppressor p53. They show that advanced PDAC remains strictly dependent on KrasG12D expression, and elimination of mutant K-Ras leads to tumor regression. Further analyses indicate that KrasG12D serves a vital role in controlling tumor metabolism through the stimulation of glucose uptake and channeling of glucose intermediates into the hexosamine biosynthesis (HBP) and pentose phosphate pathways (PPP).  Oncogenic KRas induces nucleotide biosynthesis largely through the enhancement of the nonoxidative branch of the PPP .shRNAi knockdown of Gfpt1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the HBP, reduced overall O-GlcNAcylation and inhibited  KrasG12D p53+/− mediated tumor growth in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo, suggesting oncogenic Kras is essential for the maintenance of protein glycosylation in established tumors.Together, this work shows oncogenic Kras promotes metabolic reprogramming and it identifies several oncogenic Kras regulated metabolic enzymes as targets that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit in PDAC.
