The manuscript by Ying et al. 2012 describes the development of an oncogenic kras mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and the role of kras in reprogramming tumor metabolism by activating biosynthetic pathways to maintain tumor growth. The kras mouse model was generated as a triple transgenic strain and deoxy induction provokes acinar-to-ductal metasplasia and PanIN lesions. The authors found that the iKras p53 tumors had similar features to human PDAC including glandular tumor structures, exuberant stroma, local invasion into surrounding structures and distant metastases to the liver and lung. Kras was found to regulate multiple metabolic pathways at the transcriptional level and enhance glycolytic flux, wherein glucose metabolites were found to be made under anabolic conditions. Further, Kras was found to promote nucleotide biogenesis through the nonoxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The results and implications of the manuscript were cited including the importance of metabolic transformation in cancer development, RNAi knockdown of gfpt1 reduced o-GlcNAcylation and blocked krasG12DA tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, gfpt1 is the rate limiting enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and is an important contributor to kras function in PDAC, kras mouse model resembles human PDAC, and oncogenic ras induces nucleotide synthesis through nonoxidative branch of PPP. One manuscript cited that the Ras pathway is mutated in their experiments. In conclusion, this manuscript describes the development of the novel kras mouse model of pancreatic cancer (PDAC) and describes the importance of kras in metabolic reprogramming of native tumors.
