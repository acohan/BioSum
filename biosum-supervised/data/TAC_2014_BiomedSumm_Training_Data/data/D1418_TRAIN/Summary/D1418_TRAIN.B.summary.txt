	Ying et al., 2012 reports on the role of oncogenic Kras in pancreatic tumor models. Specifically they show Kras mediates anabolic glucose metabolism and contributes to pancreatic tumor maintenance. The authors used metabolomic profiling and transcriptomic analysis to examine changes upon mutant Kras inactivation. They show Kras extinction induces significant changes in multiple metabolic pathways including glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Glycolysis is altered in response to Kras extinction through the transcriptional down regulation of several rate-limiting enzymes thus shifting glucose metabolism in favor of alternative anabolic pathways. This is consistent with findings that expression of mutant Kras induces aerobic glycolysis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The findings indicate that Kras extinction inhibits glucose uptake and results in a decrease in glycolytic intermediates. Mutant Kras, on the other hand, enhances production of these intermediates which are thought to be diverted into biosynthetic pathways including ribose biogenesis and glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis, pathways hypothesized to be fundamental for tumorigenicity. To provide support for this idea the authors demonstrate that knockdown of Gfpt1, an enzyme involved in protein glycosylation, causes a reduction in glycosylation levels similar to extinguishing Kras. Gfpt1 depletion also inhibited tumor growth as demonstrated by soft-agar growth and clonogenic assays. This strengthens the link between Kras mutation induced pancreatic cancer and protein glycosylation pathways. Overall the study demonstrates the importance of Kras mediated regulation of cell metabolism during normal and tumorigenic conditions. The findings exemplify the diverse ways Kras can alter cell signaling and metabolism to contribute to oncogenesis.
